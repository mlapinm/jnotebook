welcome back to another Inkscape tutorial
in this video I want to talk a little bit more deeply about exporting your artwork
and some considerations for if you're creating artwork for print design or for web design
and some of the different ways you'd go about exporting that
I had a comment on the YouTube channel from Jim Carnegie
and he was asking about how to create a nice smaller file size for uploading to web pages
and so we're gonna talk a little about that to Jim
and so first if we got a file and go to export PNG we know what brings up this dialog here
and I also had another comment there was a lady asking about this
and because if you go to if you dock it over here
you click this little icon
icon if I this dock
and then if we go to file export PNG it doesn't show up
so just be aware and that's not only with the export tool it's with any tool our fill and stroke are align and distribute when we dock if I something
it just appears on this little dock here and it can be kind of confusing
but that's how we get it to open if it's already open
and again if it's not open we go to file export PNG image
okay so the settings for how we export our image or over here
we have our export area if we set up the page it works off of this black page outline
which isn't shown in our final file
but it's gonna export and this one happens to be like I think it's 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels
and so the actual image that'll get exported is gonna be this 981 by 981 at 92 dpi
so what's going to affect our file size is going to be the width and the height and then also this dpi dots per inch
doesn't matter what units were working in in fact if we change this to millimeters change it to centimeters or pixels it doesn't really matter
because this is always going to be in pixels our image size our dpi is always pixels and our width and height there's always in pixels
if we click on drawing this is going to export whatever is drawn whether it's within or outside of the page
I push the minus key to zoom out a little bit
I can draw some stars over here
and now when we go to export
so if we export the drawing it's gonna take every that's drawn
even if there's a teeny-tiny little star out here
and if we go to export drawing we see our size now is massive
it's four thousand pixels by four thousand pixels
so this is gonna save to my desktop
and it's gonna be called P PNG I'll hit export
and now that appears over here
and we see it's kind of large
it's a little more that's like a then it's like a third of a megabyte it's three hundred and sixty-four kilobytes
and we can open that up and see it's sure enough exports the penguin down here with all the stars
and this last star here
so it'll export whatever the limits of our drying are
as opposed to page if week this click page and now we keep everything the same and hit export
and replace
well now this is what it looks like our final image is like this and it's about half the size
it's a hundred and eighty one kilobytes
because we export just the page
even though look our star over here is selected
we have our star selected
but if we go to export
it's going to still export
just this picture of the penguin that's because it's exporting the page not the selection
if we want to export that just this star we click on the selection
and it'll export the star
now if I just leave everything the same well looks like it changed our path
so I might need to go in here and just make sure that
I'm receiving over top of this
and click replace
now it's the star and that star is only twenty point six kilobytes
even though it was roughly I think it's about roughly the same size as the penguin
see it's a lot smaller because it just has a lot less detail
and not as many gradients not as many nodes and different points there
and so that's not to remember to your file size is gonna depend on how complex your thing is if we just select all three of these here
and then we go to export selection
we'll see how large this is
so this is about twice the size to have all these in here but it's still not very large at all 44 kilobytes
so anything under a megabyte is gonna be pretty good
let me just tell you as a rule of thumb what I would recommend if I was exporting this I'm gonna delete these stars
if I was going to export this penguin for a webpage
I would select the whole thing
I would choose selection for my export options
I would set the pixels to this 92 dpi which is what it is
and I would have the width and height to be no larger than 1920 in one direction
so this would be 1920 by 1980 that's still very very large in fact what I'd probably do is go to 1080 in one direction
and what that's gonna do if I just come over here
and go to save export replace
so now we have a nice large picture here
and we see if we if we look at it full screen it looks perfect for our screen because my screen right here is 1920 pixels wide by 1080 pixels high
if we zoom in it'll get a little bit grainy here but it's not too bad because no one's really gonna zoom in this far
in a web page in fact look it can probably get away with being a lot smaller than this
so rather than selecting it and trying to shrink it down like this
I'll just leave it I don't care what size it is over here
I'll change the size on the image size over here
the export size if I wanted to do speed like 512 by 512 or roughly it's not completely square
and I'll change this to 92 dpi again
and now this will be a smaller file size and a spot a smaller image without ever having to resize it over here on my canvas
so hit export replace and now it's half the size it's kind of hard to see here
but now if we zoom in it gets a little bit more grainy more quickly
does that make sense let's say I wanted to print this and this file size right now is 180 3.7 kilobytes
so let's say I wanted to print this
I can leave it the same size again select the whole thing
I almost always do this selection export
I don't usually do drawing drawings
and very dangerous to do I don't usually do custom
sometimes I'll do page
but if I wanted to print this maybe on like a t-shirt or a business card or something
or I want to import it into another program to print
I would set my dpi well first I get the size that I want I change this to well as we put pixels down here I change it to inches I might change my
my units two inches over here
so maybe I would resize this here
change the units to inches and maybe I want to print this on the side of a vehicle
and I want it to be I would lock this and I would I want it to be a 24 inches high
and then however wide that would make it
and I can move it over here it doesn't matter if I'm outside of my page bounds
doesn't matter if there's other objects drawn over here
because with all of this selected
then I will go to selection
and now it's it's gonna be about 24 inches by 24 inches
and I will change this to
if you're putting it on your own unlike your printer at home you do like 300 dpi
if you're having a professional company printed
you do 600 so if I gotta do 600 dpi
so this is gonna be quite large
if we export this
it was 183 kilobytes before look how long it's taken to export this is just massive
so I was taking a huge long time
which tells me I might have done something wrong when we pause the video and let this finish exporting
so this file that got created it took about a minute to create and it's 9.1 megabytes
that's actually not too bad of a file that's something that we could send to a printer and even though it's a little bit large
they want it really large for their printer they want as much data as they can get
so they can zoom in and of course with the vector graphics if we zoom in we never lose clarity while it's here in Inkscape
but once it's exported we could zoom out
and we and we could zoom in and it would start to get a little bit pixelated
we can see if we can open this file here
let me open it with a different program
it's open it in darktable
okay so this is open here in darktable
and we can see we can actually come in here and click on it and look
so we can see this is the actual PNG image
and if we zoom in here it's very sharp
this is not an SVG but it's just so incredibly sharp when we scale it gets pixelated
but that's just because we're moving around
that's related to a dark table
so we can see here this is very large this is I think 100% this is this is how far we can zoom in before it starts to get pixel
probably larger than you'd need a mess you're printing on like a billboard unless your printer asks for a huge huge huge file
so let's just a little bit about how to keep your file sizes manageable if you're doing print design it's okay to have a large file
it's just a little bit cumbersome to work with but you want that file to be quite large
I recommend doing 600 dpi when you're printing
unless you're printing at home on your printer in that case do 300 dpi
and then I would recommend doing like I said 92 for web if you really want to get kind of like a very small file you can do 72 between 92 and 72 for that
and then your sizing if it's gonna be a little icon a common size for icons is 256 by 256
or you can do like 512 by 512 just you know keep it in mind that the screen size is 1920 by 1080
so if you're designing something for us screen you know you rarely want to go above 1080i don't think
or maybe 1920 but anyway
that's a little bit of consideration
and how to reduce that file size
and I just recommend getting more comfortable that this confuses a lot of people what you're exporting
and then the unit's you're exporting in again changing this here doesn't affect the unit's down here this is always going to be in pixels
so you don't have to do a little bit of math on that in your head to figure things out
that's what I wanted to show you in this video
I realize a lot of that information is probably a repeat but just get comfortable with this
and hopefully that clarifies a little bit about exporting your artwork
and getting it into other programs and/or printing
thanks for watching go ahead and leave your questions comments below if you have any
and I'll catch you in the next video
