00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,860
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,560
Let’s get started.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,130
In this lab you’ll practice and develop
your understanding of some of the concepts

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,800
learned in the day 5 and day 6 videos on Ethernet
LAN Switching.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,460
As you can see, the network topology we will
use in this lab is like the example network

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,289
I used in those previous lecture videos, with
two switches, each with 2 PCs connected to

12
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:43,289
them.

13
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,390
Let’s get started and go through the steps.

14
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,199
First off, there is a note saying that both
switches have an empty MAC address table,

15
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,359
and all PCs have an empty ARP table.

16
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:02,350
Keep that in mind as you try to answer step
1, which asks us, if PC1 pings to PC3, what

17
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,700
messages will be sent over the network, and
which devices will receive them?

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:14,229
So, if PC1 wants to send a ping to PC3, it
has to know PC3’s MAC address.

19
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:24,079
We can type ping 192.168.1.3 on PC1 to send
a ping, but until PC1 knows PC3’s MAC address,

20
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,240
it can't send the ping.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,030
That means PC1 will have to send an ARP request.

22
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,789
So, that’s the first message.

23
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:35,040
Now, which devices will receive the ARP request?

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,390
Well, the ARP request is a broadcast message,
so ALL devices on the local network will receive

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,750
it, except for PC1 of course, which sends the
message.

26
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:51,829
PC2 and PC4 will ignore the message, but then
PC3 will send an ARP reply, which is the second

27
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:53,159
message.

28
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,409
Unlike the ARP request, which is a broadcast
message, the ARP reply is a unicast message,

29
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:05,601
so the message will be sent through SW2 and
SW1, and then be received by PC1 only, no

30
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:09,429
copies of the message will be sent to PC2
or PC4.

31
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:16,180
Then, PC1 will be able to add PC3’s MAC
Address to its ARP table, and use that information

32
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,040
as the destination address of its ping.

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,480
So, the third message that will be sent is
an ICMP echo request, from PC1.

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,000
This is a unicast message that will be received
by PC3 only.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,890
Then, PC3 will send an ICMP echo reply, which
is also a unicast message that will be received

36
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:42,320
by PC1 only, after passing through SW2 and SW1 of course.

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,020
So, that’s it, those are the messages that
will be sent over the network if PC1 pings

38
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,030
PC3.

39
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:54,440
Now, there won’t be just one ping, PC1 will
send multiple pings, 4 by default from a windows

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,940
PC.

41
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,959
Step 2 asks us to send the ping and use Packet
tracer’s ‘simulation mode’ to verify

42
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,470
our answer.

43
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,930
First, let me click on simulation mode here
in the bottom right.

44
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:17,760
Then, to send a ping from a PC in packet tracer,
click on the PC, click on desktop, and click on command prompt.

45
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,500
Now just type in the command.

46
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:29,000
PC3’s IP address is 192.168.1.3, so the
command is ping 192.168.1.3.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,900
Immediately, you can see that both an ICMP
message, the ping, and an ARP message appear.

48
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,530
I’ll click on the ICMP message, and then
click on Layer 2.

49
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,510
Look at the info here.

50
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,870
The next-hop address is a unicast.

51
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,790
The ARP process looks it up in the ARP table,
but the next-hop IP address is not in the

52
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,579
ARP table.

53
00:03:55,579 --> 00:04:01,840
The ARP process tries to send an ARP request
for that IP address and buffers this packet.

54
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,170
Buffers means it holds the packet, so it can
send it later.

55
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,590
Now let’s click on the ARP message, and
look here at the information.

56
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,360
This time I’ll click on ‘Outbound PDU
details’, which shows us detailed information

57
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,640
about the frame.  Do you recognize these fields?

58
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:28,630
Preamble, SFD, destination address, source
address, type, data, which is the encapsulated

59
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,690
packet, and then FCS.

60
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,990
If you watched my last two videos, you should
recognize all of these fields of the Ethernet

61
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,400
header and trailer.

62
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:46,009
Notice in particular the TYPE field of 0806,
which indicates ARP, and the destination MAC

63
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:49,889
address of all F’s, which is the broadcast
address.

64
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:57,229
Okay, now I’ll exit from here and click
through the process...the ARP reaches SW1,

65
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:04,900
is broadcast to PC2 and SW2, and then broadcast
to PC3 and PC4.

66
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:11,900
Only PC3 replies, this time with a unicast
message which arrives at SW2, then SW1, and

67
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,070
then PC1.

68
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:20,840
PC1 can then, finally, send its ICMP echo
request, which is unicast and goes to SW1,

69
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,760
SW2, and then PC3.

70
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:32,400
PC3 then sends the ICMP echo reply back through
SW2, SW1, and then arriving at PC1.

71
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,860
I’ll just press this play button, and you
can see the rest of the pings being sent between

72
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,900
PC1 and PC3.

73
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,389
There should be 4 in total, as these Packet
Tracer PCs operate like windows PCs.

74
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,930
Cisco devices, however, send 5 pings by default.

75
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:59,570
Now, Step 3 tells us to generate network traffic
and allow the switches to learn all MAC address of the PCs

76
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,960
on the network.

77
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,690
Remember, switches dynamically learn and enter
MAC addresses into their MAC address table

78
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,230
by looking at the source address field of
frames they receive.

79
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:17,210
So, since we just pinged between PC1 and PC3,
both switches should know their MAC addresses,

80
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,640
but just in case I’ll switch back to realtime
mode...and send one more ping from PC1 to PC3,

81
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,780
because sometimes Packet Tracer has problems with simulation mode.

82
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:36,300
Okay, next let’s send a ping from PC2 to PC4
so that the switches can learn their MAC addresses.

83
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,849
I’ll go on PC2, and now I’ll ping PC4.

84
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:48,360
Ping 192.168.1.4.

85
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,060
Step 4 asks us to use show commands on the
switches to identify the MAC address of each

86
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,030
PC.

87
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,851
Because the interface each PC is connected
to is displayed on the network diagram, if

88
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:04,540
we look for that interface in the MAC address
table we will be able to identify the MAC

89
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,759
address of each PC.

90
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,360
I’ll go on SW1.

91
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,060
We have to be in privileged exec mode to view
the MAC address table.

92
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,539
So, use the command enable, or
just 'en'.

93
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:24,110
The command to view the mac address table
is show mac SPACE address HYPHEN table.

94
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,699
Make sure you don’t mix up the space and
hyphen.

95
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:35,199
Okay, first of all let’s find PC1, which
is attached to the fastethernet 0/1 interface.

96
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,069
Here it is, and you can see the MAC address
here.

97
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,879
Note that the MAC address in your lab maybe
different, I’m not sure if packet tracer

98
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,919
keeps the MAC addresses consistent if you
load the labs up on another computer.

99
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,930
How about PC2?

100
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:57,759
Well, its connected to Fastethernet0/2, so
here is PC2’s MAC address.

101
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,349
Now, as for PC3 and PC4, we have a problem.

102
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:08,569
SW1 only knows that it can reach these two
MAC addresses via gigabit ethernet 0/1.

103
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:13,420
Just by looking at this MAC table, we don’t
know which address belongs to PC3 and which

104
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,000
belongs to PC4.

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:24,669
So, let’s go on to SW2.  Once again, I’ll
enter privileged exec mode, enable.

106
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:27,300
Now let’s view the MAC address table.

107
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,389
Show mac address-table.

108
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:38,160
PC3 is connected to fastethernet 0/1, so this
must be its MAC address, and PC4 is connected

109
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,420
to fastethernet 0/2, so this must be its MAC
Address.

110
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,471
We have successfully used the show mac address
table command to identify the MAC address

111
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:50,480
of each PC.

112
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,440
Now let’s do step 5, which is to clear the
dynamic MAC addresses from the mac address table

113
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,690
of each switch.

114
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,190
Since I’m already on SW2, I’ll start here.

115
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,370
The command is clear mac address-table dynamic,
but before I hit enter, I want to show you

116
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,370
something.

117
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:14,270
I’ll use the question mark, which is also known as 'context-sensitive
help'.

118
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,080
As you can see, it doesn’t display any additional
options here.

119
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,031
If you remember from the day 6 lecture video when
I did the demonstration in GNS3 I could clear

120
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:29,340
specific MAC addresses by specifying the address
or interface.

121
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:35,060
Packet tracer, however, does not support this
option, you have to clear all MAC addresses.

122
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,270
So I enter the command, then I’ll use the
up arrow on the keyboard to go back to the

123
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,600
show mac address-table command, enter it once
more, and you can see the mac address-table

124
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,640
is now empty.

125
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,310
I’ll do the same on SW1.

126
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,220
Clear mac address-table dynamic.

127
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,200
Press the up arrow twice to go back to the
show mac address-table command, hit enter,

128
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,370
and there we go, the address table is now
empty.

129
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,940
We have successfully completed this lab.

130
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,940
