6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,160
Thanks for your help.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,890
Let’s get started.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:31,250
In this lab we’ll finally get hands on in
the Cisco IOS CLI, the command line interface.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,500
If you’ve already watched the Day 4 lecture
video, you should be able to complete these

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,300
tasks on your own.

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,630
Even if you can, I recommend watching this
video after to check and get any additional

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,630
explanations.

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:50,400
So, we’ve got a small network here with
a few PCs, and switch, and a router.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,020
Our tasks involve some basic configurations
on the router and switch.

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,310
For this video, I will only configure the
router.

16
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,730
However, I recommend that you go through the
steps on both devices.

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,469
Repetition is essential to get used to all
of the commands you need to know, so remember

18
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:08,829
to configure both devices!

19
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:13,459
Step 1 is to set the appropriate hostnames
for each device, R1 and SW1.

20
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:19,849
We didn’t cover the command in the main
video, but to do so you use the ‘hostname’

21
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:22,920
command in global configuration mode.

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,159
Click on the device, and then select CLI to
access the command line interface from which

23
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,320
we will configure each device.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,029
Now, in the lecture video I explained about
how to connect to the console port of a device.

25
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:41,490
In packet tracer, you can actually do that,
connect a PC to the console port of the device,

26
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,880
and then use the PC to do the configurations.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,850
However, simply clicking on the device itself
is much more convenient, so that’s what

28
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,279
we’ll be doing for these labs.

29
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,920
Just keep in mind that in real life, you can’t
configure the device directly on the device

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,979
itself, you have to connect to it with a computer.

31
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,909
The current hostname for each device is displayed
here.

32
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,789
As you can see, by default the hostname is
router.

33
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,240
To change the hostname, we must
enter 'Global configuration' mode.

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,120
However to get there, we must first enter
'Privileged exec' mode.

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,780
This is achieved by using the 'enable' command.

36
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,400
To demonstrate a shortcut, I will use the
'exit' command to return to the previous exec

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,329
mode.

38
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:31,780
Notice that you can enter privileged exec
mode by simply typing 'en'.

39
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,640
You can also type 'en' and then use tab to
auto-complete it to 'enable', but this isn't

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,670
necessary.

41
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,260
'en' alone is fine.

42
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,810
'e', however, is too short, and we are told
this is an ambiguous command.

43
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,709
This is because there are other potential
commands that begin with 'e', which we can

44
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,420
see by tying 'e' and then a question mark.

45
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,330
As you can see, there are two potential commands;
enable, and exit.

46
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,030
So, if you just enter 'e', the router doesn't
know which command you mean.

47
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:09,079
However, 'enable' is the only command beginning
with 'en', so 'en' is all the router needs

48
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:12,109
to know which command you mean.

49
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,739
Now that we are in privileged exec mode, we
can use the 'configure terminal' command to

50
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,880
get to 'global configuration' mode.

51
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,379
If you want to use shortcuts again as we did
with enable and 'en', the shortest version

52
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:29,110
of the 'configure terminal' command is 'conf
t'.

53
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,020
From here we can set the hostname of the router.

54
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,969
This is done with the hostname command.

55
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:38,719
I will enter 'hostname R1'.

56
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,379
As you can see, the hostname has changed from
'router' to 'R1'.

57
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:49,370
Change the hostname of SW1 as well, and that’s
all for step 1.

58
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:55,639
Step 2 is to set the unencrypted enable password
on each router to CCNA.

59
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:02,349
The 'enable password' is used to enter privileged
exec mode, which is also called enable mode.

60
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:07,140
Previously we had no password set, so we were
able to enter privileged exec mode without

61
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,180
any password.

62
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,590
Now we are going to protect privileged exec
mode so that only administrators can access

63
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,700
it.

64
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,859
The command is simple, and it is done in 'global
configuration' mode, which we are already

65
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,530
in.

66
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,100
Type 'enable password CCNA'.

67
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,280
That's it.

68
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,600
Now let's test it out, which is step 3.

69
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,590
From here I will use the exit command twice,
once to bring me back to privileged exec mode

70
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,450
and then once again to bring me back to user exec
mode.

71
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:44,590
Now I will use the enable command again, however
this time I am asked for a password.

72
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:50,349
The characters do not appear as I type, however
if I type the password 'CCNA' correctly and

73
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:53,880
press enter I am brought to privileged exec
mode.

74
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,500
Now let's see what happens if I fail to enter
the correct password.

75
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:04,639
I enter the wrong password once, twice, and
then three times before being rejected for

76
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,020
having 'bad secrets'.

77
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,850
Now I will try again with the correct password,
and I'm in.

78
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,990
Step 3 is now complete.

79
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,590
Step 4 is simply to view the password in the
running configuration.

80
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,550
The running configuration is the current active configuration
of the router, whether or not you have actually

81
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,200
saved it.

82
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,970
If you turn off the router without saving
the running configuration you will lose any

83
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,550
changes.

84
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,670
If you want to keep your changes you have
to save them to the startup configuration.

85
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,479
To view the running configuration, use the
show running-config command from privileged

86
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,400
exec mode, which we are already in.

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,740
You can abbreviate it too, for example sh
run.

88
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,050
Enter the command, and you can see the password
right here, with the exact command we used

89
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,300
before, 'enable password CCNA'.

90
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,810
As you can see it is not encrypted, it is
written in clear text right.

91
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,669
Let’s solve that in step 5.

92
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,130
So step 4 is now complete.

93
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,349
Step 5 is to enable password encryption on
the devices.

94
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:15,840
We can protect passwords by encrypting them
to render them unreadable.

95
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,740
This is done from global configuration mode
with the command 'service password-encryption'.

96
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,389
Conf t.

97
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:24,639
service password-encryption.

98
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,199
Okay, that’s all for step 5.

99
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,770
Step 6 is to once again view the running config.

100
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,440
I will use the same command as before, and
now lets check the password.

101
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,690
However the command doesn't work.

102
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,870
That is because we are currently in global
configuration mode, and show running-config

103
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,340
must be entered from privileged exec mode.

104
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:52,150
Now, I could type exit to drop back to privileged
exec mode and then enter the command.

105
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,110
But there is one more way, which I demonstrated
in the lecture video.

106
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,570
If I type 'do' in front of the command, I
can enter it from global configuration mode.

107
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,460
'do show running-config'.

108
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,490
There we go.

109
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,199
Let's look at the password.

110
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:14,970
You can see here 'enable password', followed
by a 7 and then a string of other numbers.

111
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,020
The password has successfully been encrypted.

112
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,600
Although we didn't type this 7 when we entered
the command, it refers to the type of encryption

113
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,289
used.

114
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,599
There are other types as well.

115
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,270
The string of numbers that follow are the
password 'CCNA', encrypted to be unreadable

116
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,970
so that anyone looking over our shoulder can't
read the password.

117
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,470
Keep in mind that the encryption used in the
'service password-encryption' isn't very secure

118
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,990
and can be cracked, but this at least renders
the password safe from someone simply glancing

119
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,480
over your shoulder.

120
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,620
Step 6 is now complete.

121
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:56,090
Step 7 is to configure a more secure, encrypted
enable password of ‘Cisco’.

122
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,340
That can be done with the ‘enable secret’
command.

123
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,910
The enable secret uses MD5 encryption, which
is more secure than what you get with the

124
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,460
service password-encryption command.

125
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,620
Since we’re already in global configuration
mode, let’s enter the command.

126
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,910
Enable secret Cisco.

127
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,500
Now let’s go on to Step 8, which is to exit
back to user EXEC mode and try to login.

128
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,570
Exit.

129
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,639
Exit.

130
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,569
Okay, now let’s try to get back to privileged
EXEC mode.

131
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:27,569
Enable.

132
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:33,890
Let’s try our original password of ‘CCNA’….it
doesn’t work anymore.

133
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,260
How about our newly configured enable secret?

134
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,190
Cisco...okay, that works.

135
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,610
As you can see, if both an enable secret and
enable password are configured, only the enable

136
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,560
secret can be used.

137
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,310
The enable password becomes invalid.

138
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,260
Step 9 is to once again view the passwords
in the running configuration.

139
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,160
Show running-config.

140
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,560
There they are.

141
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,860
Once again, the enable password with service
password-encryption enabled uses type 7 encryption,

142
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,510
indicated by this 7 here.

143
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:13,680
The enable secret uses type 5 encryption,
which is MD5 encryption.

144
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,310
Step 10 is to save the running configuration
to the startup configuration.

145
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,780
There are three ways to do this.

146
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:29,670
One is write...another is write memory...and
the third is copy running-config startup-config.

147
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,320
Let’s check if its saved.

148
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,520
Show startup-config.

149
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,260
There's the config, and you can see the passwords
we configured here.

150
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,500
If I scroll through you can see lots of other
default settings for the device here.

151
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,560
Step 10 is now complete.

152
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,820
Thank you for watching.

153
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,500
