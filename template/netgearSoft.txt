ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Five Levels of Protection

File and data protection strategies such as various RAID levels or snapshots can go only so far in protecting data from loss, but ReadyNAS OS provides five separate strategies that work together to provide substantially better protection than any one strategy.

The different levels of disk redundancy provided by RAID types provide degrees of file protection from the loss of one or more disks, but cannot do anything about accidental deletion or corruption; can mask, but not prevent, gradual corruption caused by the slow degradation of the disks; and cannot provide protection from a site disaster. Snapshot technologies provide protection against accidental deletion or corruption but by themselves cannot protect against disk loss or site loss.

ReadyNAS OS allows you to use five different types of protection simultaneously:

â¢

RAID. Protects against disk failure.

â¢

Snapshot technology. Protects against accidental data deletion or corruption by providing point-in-time recovery.

â¢

Real-time antivirus. Protects against loss or corruption from viruses.

â¢

Bit rot protection. Protects against the degradation of data from disk aging.

â¢

Offsite backup. Protects against site loss.

Volume Configuration

This chapter describes how to configure and manage the volumes in your ReadyNAS storage system. It includes the following sections:

Basic Volume and RAID Concepts

â¢

ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Basic Volume and RAID Concepts

To get the most out of your ReadyNAS storage system, it is helpful to understand the basics of volumes and RAID. Understanding these concepts is the first step to making good decisions about how to configure, manage, and use your ReadyNAS storage system.

Volumes

In the most general sense, volumes are data storage devices. Your computer treats an internal hard drive as a volume. It also treats a portable USB thumb drive as a volume.

Volumes can be either physical or logical. Usually, the term physical volume refers to a hard disk drive.

When this term is used in this way, a two-bay storage system can be made up of up to two physical volumes (hard disk drives). A four-bay storage system can be made up of up to four physical volumes. A six-bay storage system can be made up of up to six physical volumes.

The term logical volume refers to the way that you divide, or partition, your storage space. For example:

â¢

Each logical volume can correspond to a hard disk drive.

â¢

A logical volume can be made up of more than one hard disk drive.

In this manual, the term volume refers to a logical volume. The terms hard disk drive and disk refer to a physical volume.

RAID

Your ReadyNAS storage system allows you to configure your hard disks using one of the many RAID

technologies.

RAID is short for redundant array of independent disks. RAID is a storage technology that balances data protection, system performance, and storage space by determining how the storage system distributes data.

Many different ways of distributing data are standardized into various RAID levels. Each RAID level offers a tradeoff of data protection, system performance, and storage space. For example, one RAID level might improve data protection but reduce storage space. Another RAID level might increase storage space but also reduce system performance.

Your ReadyNAS storage system supports X-RAIDâ¢ mode, a proprietary single-volume RAID architecture that is easy to administer, and Flex-RAID mode, which allows you to format your disks in a variety of industry-standard RAID levels.

When you power on your system for the first time or if you reset your system to its factory default settings, the optimal RAID mode and level are automatically selected for you based on the number of disks that are installed. You can also configure the RAID settings manually (see Change RAID Mode on page 25).

X-RAID

X-RAID is an autoexpandable RAID technology that is available only on ReadyNAS systems. With X-RAID, you do not need to know intricate details about RAID to administer your system. X-RAID allows you to add storage space without reformatting your drives or moving your data to another location. Because the expansion happens online, you can continue to use your ReadyNAS system while the volume capacity increases.

Volume Configuration

22



ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Because X-RAID is a single-volume architecture, if you configure your hard disk drives to use X-RAID, your storage system includes only one volume that is made up of all installed hard disk drives. X-RAIDâs single-volume architecture provides two major advantages:

â¢

Easy system management

â¢

Auto expansion

Adding disks to a Flex-RAID formatted system is more complex. Disks must be added in ways compatible with the RAID level, or you must back up the data to another system, add a disk, reformat the RAID volume, and restore the data to the new RAID volume. With X-RAID, none of those administrative tasks are required.

Instead, with X-RAID, your volume automatically expands to accommodate additional disks or larger-capacity disks.

With X-RAID, you can start out with one hard disk, add a second disk for data protection, and add more disks for additional storage capacity. X-RAID accommodates the new disks automatically. You can replace existing disks with larger-capacity disks and X-RAID automatically accommodates the new disks.

X-RAID requires a minimum of two hard disks to provide protection against disk failure. If you use a one-disk ReadyNAS storage system and want protection from disk failure, you must add a second disk that is at least as large as the first. It can be added while the system is running.

X-RAID uses the capacity of one disk for data storage and reserves the capacity of a second disk for data protection, which allows the volume to recreate data if a disk fails. In a two-disk system, the usable storage space is one disk. In a three-disk system, the usable storage space is two disks. In general, the total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of all your disks minus the capacity of one disk.

The following figure illustrates how X-RAID uses new disks.

Figure 4. X-RAID disk usage

ReadyNAS OS 6.5

1.

The first disk that you install is used for initial (unprotected) storage space.

2.

The second disk that you install is reserved for data protection (parity information).

3.

Installing additional disks increases your storage space.

Note X-RAID reserves the capacity of one disk for data protection. The actual space reserved for data protection is distributed across all disks.

Flex-RAID

NETGEARâs Flex-RAID technology allows you to choose from among several industry-standard RAID levels:

â¢

JBOD. This most basic RAID level does not protect your data from loss if one of your drives fails. JBOD

is available only on volumes consisting of a single hard disk.

â¢

RAID 0. RAID 0 distributes data across multiple disks, resulting in improved disk performance compared to systems that do not use RAID formatting. The total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of the smallest of your disk drives times the number of disks. RAID 0 is available on volumes consisting of two or more hard disks.

â¢

RAID 1. This RAID level provides full redundancy of your data, because it duplicates data across multiple disks. Exactly the same data is stored on two or more disks at all times. RAID 1 protects your data from loss if one disk fails. The total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of your smallest disk.

â¢

RAID 5. This RAID level also provides data redundancy, but it requires at least three disks. RAID 5 uses the capacity of one disk to protect you from data loss if one disk fails. Your data is distributed across multiple disks to improve disk performance. The total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of all your disks minus the capacity of one disk. It is supported on systems with at least four drive bays.

â¢

RAID 6. This RAID level provides recovery from the loss of two disks. Your data is distributed across multiple disks to improve disk performance. The total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of all your disks minus the capacity of two disks. It is supported on systems with at least four drive bays.

â¢

RAID 10 (or 1+0). This RAID level uses both RAID 1 and RAID 0 technology. First, your data is duplicated so that exactly the same data is stored on two or more disks. Then the data is distributed across additional disks to improve disk performance. It is supported on systems with at least four drive bays.

â¢

RAID 50 (or 5+0). This RAID level uses both RAID 5 and RAID 0 technology. First, a disk is used to provide redundancy. Then your data is distributed across multiple disks to improve disk performance.

A minimum of six disks are required. The total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of all your disks minus the capacity of two disks.

â¢

RAID 60 (or 6+0). This RAID level uses both RAID 6 and RAID 0 technology. First, two disks are used to provide redundancy. Then your data is distributed across multiple disks to improve disk performance.

A minimum of eight disks are required. The total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of all of your disks minus the capacity of four disks.

The Flex-RAID levels that you can select depend on the number of disks included in the volume. The following table describes the Flex-RAID levels that are available for a given number of disks. It also indicates whether adding a disk for data protection is possible for each configuration.

Manage Volumes

You can manage volumes on your ReadyNAS system. You can add or delete volumes from the system.

Additionally, you can change the volumeâs RAID mode and level, check volume status, perform volume maintenance, and configure volume protection.You can also extend the storage capacity on you ReadyNAS

system.

Change RAID Mode

You can change the RAID mode that your ReadyNAS storage system uses. By default, your systemâs hard disks are configured into a single X-RAID volume.

Change From X-RAID to Flex-RAID

Your ReadyNAS system can easily change a volume from X-RAID to Flex-RAID mode. Data on the X-RAID

volume is preserved when you switch to Flex-RAID. The RAID level of the resulting Flex-RAID volume is automatically assigned based on the number of disks that are installed.

Change From Flex-RAID to X-RAID

If your system contains only one volume, you can easily switch from Flex-RAID to X-RAID. Data on the Flex-RAID volume is preserved when you switch to X-RAID.

If your system contains multiple volumes, you must first reconfigure your disks into a single volume.

Note When you switch to X-RAID mode, any extra disks installed in your system are automatically reformatted and used for storage expansion.You cannot change the RAID mode of a RAID 0 or RAID 10 volume.

Configure the Checksum Function

Checksum functions help detect data transmission errors. The ReadyNAS uses a checksum function to improve accuracy and consistency when writing data to a volume. You can enable or disable the checksum function on each volume. Enabling the checksum function improves the integrity of your data but reduces performance speeds.

Bit rot protection uses the checksum functions to detect a read error. For information and bit rot protection,

see Bit Rot Protection on page 47.

Create and Encrypt a Volume

During volume creation you can also enable volume encryption. Encryption is optional. When encryption is enabled, data is encrypted in real time as it is written to the volume. You cannot encrypt existing volumes.

Encryption is possible only when you are creating new volumes. When created, the volume will be a Flex-RAID

volume, but after you create it, you can change it to an X-RAID volume.

Volume Configuration

31





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

You need a USB drive to store the encryption key that is generated during volume creation. You can also specify that the encryption key be emailed to you for safe keeping. If you lose the USB drive with the encryption key, you can load the emailed encryption key onto another USB drive.

You must insert the USB drive with the encryption key into a USB port on the ReadyNAS for the volume to be unlocked and accessible. You must insert the USB drive to unlock an encrypted volume during reboot.

If you do not insert the USB key on reboot, there is a 10-minute time-out during which you can insert the key. Otherwise, you wll not be able to access the encrypted volume until the ReadyNAS is again rebooted.

You can remove the USB drive after unlocking the volume. We recommend storing the USB drive with the encryption key in a safe and secure location when not in use.

WARNING:

If you lose the encryption key, the encrypted drive is irrecoverable.

To create a volume, select the RAID level, and enable encryption: 1.

6.

Click the Destroy button.

The volume is deleted. The disks that were part of the volume become available again for other purposes (the color of the disks turns black).

Expand Storage Capacity

You can expand the storage capacity of an existing volume in two ways:

â¢

Horizontal expansion. Expand the volume by adding more disks to the volume.

â¢

Vertical expansion. Expand the volume by replacing disks in the volume with larger-capacity disks.

Both horizontal and vertical expansion is available for X-RAID and Flex-RAID volumes.

X-RAID makes horizontal volume expansion easy. If your X-RAID volume includes two or more disks, the volume expands automatically when you add disks.

When you expand a Flex-RAID volume you need to add disks in increments compatible with the RAID level of the volume.

You can continue to use your ReadyNAS system while the new disks are incorporated in the background.

The process of volume expansion can take several hours. If you set up email notifications for your system, you receive an email message when the process finishes. For more information about alert notifications,

see Configure System Alerts on page 150.

Horizontally Expand an X-RAID Volume

To horizontally expand an X-RAID volume:

Add a disk to an X-RAID volume that includes two or more disks.

For more information about how to add a disk to your ReadyNAS system, see the hardware manual for your system, which is available at http://support.netgear.com/product/ReadyNAS-OS6.

The system automatically determines whether the new disk is used for protection or storage. When you add a second disk, the new disk is used for data protection. When you add a third or fourth disk, the new disk Volume Configuration

34



ReadyNAS OS 6.5

is used to increase your storage capacity. For more information, see X-RAID on page 22. New disks are incorporated in the background while you continue to use your storage system.

Horizontally Expand a Flex-RAID Volume

Horizontal expansion of a Flex-RAID volume is possible, but more complex and less space efficient than expanding an X-RAID volume. In effect, you create a new Flex-RAID volume and ReadyNAS OS uses both the existing and new volumes as parts of the same larger volume. Other configurations are possible, but We recommend expanding the volume by the same number of disks as the original volume; for example, expand a 3-disk RAID 5 Flex-RAID volume by adding three disks.

To horizontally expand a Flex-RAID volume:

1.

Add disks to the ReadyNAS, if necessary.

For more information about how to add a disk to your ReadyNAS system, see the hardware manual for your system, which is available at http://support.netgear.com/product/ReadyNAS-OS6.

2.

Log in to the admin page.

3.

Select System > Volumes.

4.

Select the volume to expand.

5.

Select the unallocated disks to add to the volume.

When you select enough disks to expand the volume, Expand Volume and Cancel buttons appear on the volume.

6.

Select the Expand Volume button.

A Window opens explaining what is about to happen.

7.

Select the Expand button.

The volume expands immediately, but requires a resync, which starts immediately. The volume display includes a resync progress bar.

Vertically Expand a Volume

Both X-RAID and Flex-RAID volumes support vertical expansion.

When you vertically expand a Flex-RAID volume, you must replace all disks in the volume with larger-capacity disks.

Note Vertical expansion is not available for RAID 0 volumes.

When you vertically expand an X-RAID volume, you must replace disks in the volume according to the following table.

Volume Configuration

35





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Table 2. X-RAID vertical expansion requirements

RAID Level Disk Replacements Required for Vertical Expansion

RAID 1

Replace 2 or more disks with larger-capacity disks.

RAID 5

Replace 2 or more disks with larger-capacity disks.

RAID 6

Replace 4 or more disks with larger-capacity disks.

If you replace fewer disks than required for vertical expansion, the disks are reserved for data protection.

Your available storage capacity does not increase to accommodate the reserved disks until you replace the required number of disks.

IMPORTANT:

To reduce the risk of data loss, We recommend that you back up your data before vertically expanding a volume.

To vertically expand an X-RAID volume:

1.

Replace one disk in the volume with a larger-capacity disk.

For more information about how to add a disk to your system, see the hardware manual for your system, which is available at http://support.netgear.com/product/ReadyNAS-OS6.

Note You must use supported disks in your ReadyNAS system. For a list of supported disks, visit http://www.netgear.com/readynas-hcl.

2.

Wait for the volume to resync your data.

You can continue to use your ReadyNAS system while the volume is resyncing. Resyncing can take several hours. The start and completion of the resyncing process are recorded in the system log (see

System Logs on page 187).

If you set up email notifications for your system, you receive an email message when the process finishes. For more information about alert notifications, see Configure System Alerts on page 150.

Add Protection to a Volume

You can set up protection against disk failure. The types of protection available depend on the number of hard disks installed in the ReadyNAS system.

Add Protection to an X-RAID Volume

X-RAID requires a minimum of two hard disks to provide protection against disk failure. To add protection from disk failure to a one-disk ReadyNAS storage system, you must add a second disk that is at least as large as the first. You can add it while the system is running. For more information about how to add a disk to your system, see the hardware manual for your system, which is available at

http://support.netgear.com/product/ReadyNAS-OS6.

An X-RAID volume that includes two or more disks is automatically formatted to protect against the failure of one disk. Except for very large ReadyNAS systems (for example 12-bay systems, if you want to protect your data against the failure of two disks, you must switch to Flex-RAID and select RAID 6. (Very large ReadyNAS systems use RAID 6 by default.) To use RAID 6, you must install four or more disks. For more information about how to switch to Flex-RAID, see Change from X-RAID to Flex-RAID on page 25.

Add Protection to a Flex-RAID Volume

In certain cases, you can add a disk to a Flex-RAID volume to increase data protection. The following table indicates whether adding a disk for data protection is possible for each Flex-RAID configuration.

Note Without a volume, you cannot configure any shared folders. For information about how to create volumes, see Create and Encrypt a Volume on page 31.

43





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Basic Shared Folder Concepts

The volumes on your ReadyNAS can be divided into shared folders and logical unit numbers (LUNs), both of which are logical entities on one or more disks. Shared folders and LUNs enable you to organize data in a volume by type, group, user, department, and so on. A single volume can contain multiple shared folders and LUNs.

Shared folders are NAS data sets that allow data transfer and storage over a network. You can create a maximum of 1,024 shared folders on the ReadyNAS. The local admin page displays shared folders in the following way:

Figure 5. Shared folder with file-sharing protocols enabled

Figure 6. Shared folder with file-sharing protocols disabled

Shared folders are configured independently of one another, even though multiple shared folders can reside on the same volume. You can configure properties of a shared folder, including compression, protection, file-sharing protocols, and access rights.You can also specify whether and how often a snapshot is created.

These properties are explained in this chapter.

Data Organization

Shared folders are the way that you group your data.You might want to group your data by type, for example:

â¢

Documents

â¢

Music

â¢

Pictures

â¢

Videos

Organizations might choose to group data by department:

â¢

Accounting

â¢

Sales

â¢

Personnel

You can combine these schemes or come up with your own scheme.

Shared Folder Defaults

If you used ReadyCLOUD or the local setup wizard to configure your desktop ReadyNAS storage system, the following shared folders are created for you:

Shared Folders

44





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

â¢

Documents

â¢

Music

â¢

Pictures

â¢

Videos

These folders are not automatically created on rack-mount ReadyNAS storage systems.

If you want, you can delete or rename these shared folders. You can create other shared folders to organize your data.

File and Folder Names

A shared folder can contain subfolders to help you organize your data files. If all characters in the file or folder name are alphanumeric, the maximum length of the name is 255 characters. If you use other kinds of characters, the maximum length might be reduced. For example, if a file or folder name uses Kanji or Hanzi characters, the maximum length of the name might be 83 characters.

File-Sharing Protocols

You can access shared folders over a LAN or WAN network. Network access to data stored on your ReadyNAS system is managed by file-sharing protocols, which handle the transfer of data. You can access a shared folder on your ReadyNAS from other network-attached devices (for example, a laptop or a tablet) if you enable the file-sharing protocol that the network-attached device uses to access the ReadyNAS. You can enable multiple protocols for an individual shared folder, allowing users to access the shared folder through various methods. Some file-sharing protocols, UPnP, SNMP, SSH and antivirus, apply to the ReadyNAS system as a whole, not to indvidual folders.

For information about how to configure and enable file-sharing protocols for shared folders, see Set Network

Access Rights to Shared Folders on page 55. For information about how to configure UPnP, SNMP, SSH, and antivirus, see Configure Global Settings for System Services on page 163.

Quotas on Shared Folders

You can set and change quotas on shared folders. Without a quota, a shared folder can use all of the space on the volume it resides on. You cannot set quotas on home folders. Quotas are a property of the folder and can be set when the folder is created, or added or changed like any folder property.

ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Bit Rot Protection

Bit rot is a term sometimes used to describe the gradual changes in disks causing a slow loss of reliability.

ReadyNAS OS can use the checksum functions to check for bit rot and the redundancy in RAID-protected disks to rewrite corrected data.

RAID levels other than RAID 0 provide data redundancy used to detect, and in some cases correct, disk read errors. Sometimes a read error is a one-time error, but other times, the data on the disk is no longer reliable because of changes to the disk with age (disk bit rot). With bit rot protection turned on, when an error is detected, the data is rewritten, which restores the reliability of the data, in effect restarting the clock on the bit rot.

Bit rot protection is available for any folder stored on your ReadyNAS system. On higher-end models it is on by default. Bit rot protection can slow the performance of a system and increase fragmentation, and so is not on by default on lower-end models.

Managing Bit Rot Protection

Bit rot protection can protect your data from the gradual loss of reliability of disks as they age. It can impact performance, so you can turn it on and off for individual folders. Bit rot protection is also called copy-on-write.

To set or change bit rot settings:

1.

Log in to your ReadyNAS system.

2.

Select Shares > Browse.

3.

Right-click the folder.

If you want to change the setting, select or clear the check box.

Home Folders

Starting in OS version 6.2, every account on a ReadyNAS owns a private folder. The content of your home folder is not visible to the other accounts on the ReadyNAS (except the admin account). You can share the ReadyNAS with other people while keeping content private.

You use it like any other folder on the ReadyNAS system. If you use a private Time Machine to back up a Mac, that Time Machine is stored in your home directory. Snapshots, if used, of content within the home folder are also within the home folder, with the same protection. Your home folder is created the first time you log into the ReadyNAS system.

If a user account is deleted, the home folder for that account, and all of the content within it, is deleted.

You can view your folder by clicking Shares > Shares > Home Folders or Shares > Browse > home.

Manage Shared Folders

From the local admin page, you can create, modify, delete, and browse shared folders on your ReadyNAS.

Access Shared Folders From a Network-Attached Device

You can remotely access shared folders and snapshots on your storage system using other network-attached devices, such as a laptop or tablet. The network-attached device must support one of the enabled file-sharing protocols. How a shared folder is accessed depends on the OS of the network-attached device, the file-sharing protocols that you enabled for shared folder access, and the access rights that you granted (see Shared

Folder Access Rights on page 53).

Note For snapshots to be accessible to users from their network-attached devices, you must select the Allow snapshot access check box on the shared folder settings window. For more information, see View and Change the Properties of a Shared

Folder on page 50.

Use a Web Browser

You can use a web browser to access files that are stored on your ReadyNAS system.

If you allowed anonymous access when you enabled the FTP-file sharing protocol, log in as anonymous and use your email address for the password.

Use Rsync

You can use Rsync to access any shared folders that are enabled for the Rsync file-sharing protocol. Instead of browsing shared folders as you do with some other file-sharing protocols, with Rsync, you copy files from your ReadyNAS system to another computer that supports the Rsync file-sharing protocol. If you previously copied these files, Rsync copies only the differences between the source files and the destination files, making the transfer much quicker than using other file-sharing protocols. The first time you copy files using the Rsync file-sharing protocol, you see no performance difference.

To access shared folders using Rsync:

1.

Ensure that the Rsync file-sharing protocol is enabled on your ReadyNAS storage system.

For more information, see Set Network Access Rights to Shared Folders on page 55.

2.

ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Basic LUN Concepts

The volumes on your ReadyNAS can be divided into shares and logical unit numbers (LUNs), both of which are logical entities on one or more disks. Shares and LUNs enable you to organize data in a volume by type, group, user, department, and so on. A single volume can contain multiple shares and LUNs.

LUNs are SAN (storage area network) data sets that allow data transfer and storage over iSCSI and Fibre Channel devices. The ReadyNAS supports iSCSI devices only. Each ReadyNAS system supports up to 256 LUNs. The local admin page displays LUNs in the following way: Figure 7. Thin LUN

Figure 8. Thick LUN

Each LUN is configured independently of other LUNs that reside on the same volume. You can configure settings such as compression, protection, provisioning, LUN size, and access rights. You can also specify whether and how often a snapshot is created. These settings are explained in the following sections.

Thin and Thick Provisioning

You can specify the size of a LUN in two ways:

â¢

Thin. A thin LUN lets you overallocate its size. That is, you can assign a LUN size that is larger than the size of the volume. Even though you specify the size of a thin LUN when you create it, storage space is assigned on demand instead of up front. This method greatly improves the utilization rate of the LUN

because storage space is assigned only as data is written to the LUN. However, the size of the LUN is reported as the total storage space that you specify when you create the LUN.

You can expand a volume as needed (if necessary, adding disks in the process) without expanding the size of the LUN and therefore, without disconnecting users. Make sure that you watch the volume capacity of the volume on which the overallocated LUN resides so you do not run out of storage space unexpectedly.

Note We recommend that you do not use an overallocated LUN for storage of critical data.

Instead, use a thick LUN.

â¢

Thick. All storage space that you specify when you create a thick LUN is allocated up front and the storage space is reserved on the volume. Snapshots, other LUNs, and shared folders on the volume cannot consume storage space that is reserved. The size of the LUN is reported as the total storage space that you specify when you create the LUN. You cannot assign more storage space than the available nonreserved storage space on the volume.

LUN Groups and Access Rights

When you create a LUN, the LUN is unassigned. To access your storage system from an iSCSI-attached device, you must create a LUN group and assign one or more LUNs to the LUN group.

LUN groups allow you to organize LUNs and manage access rights to LUN groups. Access rights are either open or granted through internal CHAP authentication. Access rights apply to LUN groups, not to individual LUNs. You can easily assign a LUN to a LUN group or move a LUN from one LUN group to another LUN

group.

Each LUN group is assigned an iSCSI target address (for example, iqn.1994-11.com.netgear:f2f2fdd4) that allows iSCSI clients to access the LUN group. For more information, see Manage Access Rights for LUN

Groups on page 87. Each ReadyNAS supports a maximum of 256 iSCSI targets.

Access LUN Groups From an iSCSI-Attached Device

An iSCSI initiator application lets you set up a connection from a server to a LUN group (and therefore to individual LUNs). Normally, users would not initiate such a LUN connection. The network administrator would provide access to a LUN group through a server.

The iSCSI targets (that is, the LUNs in the LUN group on the ReadyNAS) present themselves on the client system as virtual block devices and can be treated as a locally attached disks. Windows, for instance, can run FAT32 or NTFS on the iSCSI target device and treat the devices as though they were locally attached.

When they can access a LUN group, users can employ any backup application to back up local data from their iSCSI-attached device to a LUN.

Note Unlike snapshots that reside on a share, snapshots that reside on a LUN are not visible to users. For information about how to recover data using a snapshot on a LUN, see

Recover Data from a Snapshot to an iSCSI-Attached Device on page 113.

Accessing LUN groups from iSCSI-attached devices requires these high-level steps: 1.

Set up iSCSI initiator access to the LUN group.

See Set Up Initiator Access on page 94.

2.

Initialize and format LUNs in the LUN group.

See Initialize and Format LUNs on page 99.

Set Up Initiator Access

The following procedure uses the Microsoft iSCSI Software Initiator, which is freely available online and is integrated in Windows 7 and later.

Note If you use an operating system other than Windows, the steps are different, but the basic tasks remain the same.

Note Some of the steps in this procedure require that the Windows iSCSI service is running.

If it is not, when you open the iSCSI initiator, Windows asks if you want it started.

see Create a LUN on page 77.

102





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Basic Snapshot Concepts

The ReadyNAS can provide protection of shared folders and LUNs through snapshots. Snapshots contain references to data on a shared folder or LUN. They take no space until the data they reference is changed or deleted. Strictly speaking, snapshots are not backups, but they function as backups because you can recover data from snapshots.

You can take snapshots only of shared folders or LUNs.You cannot take a snapshot of a volume. Snapshots reside on the same volume as the shared folder or LUN from which they were created.

The ReadyNAS can automatically take snapshots of a shared folder or LUN according to a schedule that you specify. You can also manually take or delete individual snapshots at any time. Depending on available storage space, you can keep an unlimited number of snapshots.

WARNING:

When the available storage space on a volume decreases below a threshold (set to a default of 5 percent) of the volumeâs total storage space, the oldest automatic snapshots are automatically deleted to bring the available storage space back to the threshold or higher. Manual snapshots are never automatically deleted. The threshold is part of the snapshot settings for a volume.

Once protection is available, the shared folders and LUNs on the Shares page indicate the number of snapshots and the number of days with protection.

Figure 9. Shared folder with daily snapshots

Note For snapshots to be accessible to users from their network-attached device you must select the Allow snapshot access check box in the shared folder or LUN settings window.

For more information, see View and Change the Properties of a Shared Folder on page

50.

Smart Snapshot Management

ReadyNAS OS 6.1 and later uses Smart Snapshot Management to reduce the number of automatic (continuous) snapshots per shared folder or LUN. Every hour, this feature automatically prunes older hourly, daily, and weekly snapshots, according to the following rules:

â¢

Hourly snapshots are kept for 48 hours.

â¢

Daily snapshots are kept for four weeks.

Snapshots

103





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

â¢

Weekly snapshots are kept for eight weeks.

â¢

Monthly snapshots are kept for as long as there is sufficient capacity. (The last weekly snapshot in a month becomes the monthly snapshot for that month.)

Note The Smart Snapshot Management feature does not prune manual snapshots.

Rolling Back

You can replace a shared folder or LUN with an earlier version by rolling back to a snapshot. When you roll back to a snapshot, the entire shared folder or LUN is replaced with the version captured by the snapshot.

All snapshots that were taken after the snapshot that was used for rolling back are deleted. For information about how to roll back to a snapshot, see Roll Back to a Snapshot on page ?.

Clones

You can copy a snapshot to become a new independent shared folder or LUN. Changes made to the clone do not affect the parent shared folder or LUN and changes made to the parent do not affect the clone. For information about how to clone snapshots, see Clone Snapshots on page 109.

View and Change Share Snapshot Properties

Recover Data From a Snapshot

The best way to protect against data loss is to back up your data. Regularly taking snapshots of your data can also help prevent loss, because you can recover data from snapshots.

Recover Data From a Snapshot to a Network-Attached Device

Recovering data from a snapshot to a network-attached device, such as a laptop or tablet, involves the following high-level steps:

1.

Enable access to snapshots.

You must allow users to access snapshots from network-attached devices. You can grant access to snapshots by selecting the Allow snapshot access check box when you configure the properties of a shared folder. For more information, see View and Change the Properties of a Shared Folder on page 50.

2.

Access a shared folder from a network-attached device.

Snapshots reside on the same volume as the shared folder (or LUN) from which they were created.

After you enable access to snapshots, users can access snapshots of shared folders according to their access rights. Users with access to a shared folder can access its snapshots. Users without access to a shared folder cannot access its snapshots. For more information about accessing a shared folder from a network-attached device, see Access Shared Folders from a Network-Attached Device on page 70.

3.

Locate the snapshot data on the ReadyNAS.

Snapshot data is stored in a snapshot subfolder within the shared folder. Users with read/write access to the shared folder can explore the snapshot data and recover earlier versions of files or folders.

Snapshots

112





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Recover Data From a Snapshot to an iSCSI-Attached Device

Strictly speaking, users who access the ReadyNAS through an iSCSI-attached device cannot access snapshots. However, you can clone a snapshot of a LUN to become a new independent LUN, and then assign the LUN clone to a LUN group that the users can access.

To recover data from the LUN clone, users must access the LUN clone from the same type of iSCSI-attached device that was used to format the parent of the clone. For example, if the parent LUN was formatted using a Windows device, users must access the LUN clone using a Windows device.

Recovering data from a snapshot to an iSCSI-attached device involves the following high-level steps: 1.

Clone a snapshot of a LUN.

See Clone Snapshots on page 109. Cloning a snapshot of a LUN creates a new independent LUN.

2.

Assign the LUN clone to a LUN group that the users can access.

See Assign a LUN to a LUN Group on page 86.

The LUN clone appears on the iSCSI-attached device as a virtual block device. The iSCSI-attached device treats LUNs in the LUN group as locally attached disks. Now users can access the LUN clone from the iSCSI-attached device.

3.

Locate the snapshot data on the LUN clone from the iSCSI-attached device.

Users can access data on the LUN clone according to their access rights. Users with read/write access to the LUNs in the LUN group can explore the snapshot data in the LUN clone and recover any desired data.

ReadyNAS OS 6.5

User and Group Accounts

Users are the people to whom you grant access to your storage system. If your company uses Windows Active Directory, you can use that to manage ReadyNAS users. Otherwise, when you want to allow someone to access your ReadyNAS system, you create a user account for that person. The ReadyNAS storage system administrator sets up user accounts and decides which folders and LUNs each user is permitted to access.

If your ReadyNAS storage system is used at home, you might create a user account for each member of the family, but allow only the parents to access financial data stored on your system. You might decide that all user accounts can access photos and music stored on the system.You can set the appropriate permissions for each user.

The ReadyNAS system administrator can set up groups to make it easier to manage large numbers of users.

For example, if your ReadyNAS storage system is being used in a business, you might decide that every employee requires a user account. However, you might decide that only users in the accounting department can access information in the accounting shared folder, but that all users can access data stored in the company benefits shared folder. You can create a group for each department and place all users in the appropriate group or groups.

Home Folders

Home folders allow each user a private folder matching his or her account name. Home folders are automatically created when a user account is created. By default, home folders are available over SMB, AFP, and NFS protocols and are available optionally over FTP and DLNA protocols. All can be disabled.

You can control whether or not snapshots are enabled for home folders. You enable or disable snapshot protection for home folders through a switch for the default user (Accounts > Default User). If snapshot protection is enabled here, you can enable or disable it for individual home folders when viewing it in the Shares tab.

User and Group Account Limitations

You can create up to 8,192 user accounts and up to 8,192 group accounts on your ReadyNAS storage system. However, creating many accounts on your system can degrade its performance, so we recommend that you create and maintain only those accounts that you need, preferably fewer than 250.

When you add a user, a private home folder is created for that user. This private home folder is visible only to the user and the system administrator.

User and Group Management Modes

You can choose between two modes to manage user and group accounts on your ReadyNAS: Local Users mode and Active Directory mode. You configure either one or the other:

â¢

Local Users mode. This mode lets you manually manage user and group accounts on your ReadyNAS

storage system using its local database.

â¢

Active Directory mode. This mode requires an Active Directory database. If you use Active Directory mode, you do not use your ReadyNAS system to manage your users and groups. Instead, you manage Users and Groups

115

them with your Active Directory database and the changes are transferred to your ReadyNAS system every 12 hours.

To configure Local Users mode:

1.

Log in to the ReadyNAS.

2.

Select Accounts > Authentication.

3.

In the Access Type menu, select Local users.

4.

(Optional) Enter a name for the workgroup.

Item

Description

NetBIOS Domain Name

Enter the name of the NetBIOS domain, for example, company. Normally, the NetBIOS domain name is identical to the prefix of the DNS realm name.

If the NetBIOS domain name does not properly represent the organizational structure or does not match the prefix naming rules, the name differs from the prefix of the DNS realm name.

DNS Realm Name (FQDN)

Enter the DNS realm name, which is normally the DNS domain name or the Active Directory domain name, for example, company.community.com, where company is the prefix, and community is the suffix of the name.

Container OU

This setting is optional. Specify the location of the computer account of the ReadyNAS in the Active Directory. By default, the computer account for the ReadyNAS is placed in the Computers organizational unit (OU), but you can use the Container OU field to specify another OU. You can specify OUs by separating OU entries with slashes. Specify the lowest-level OU first.

Note The name of the computer account (also referred to as the machine account) is the same as the host name of the

ReadyNAS (see Configure the Host Name on page 150).

Included Trusted Domains

Select the Include Trusted Domains check box to include active directory domains, and their accounts, recognized as trusted by the Active Directory used by the ReadyNAS system.

Administrator Name

Enter the name of the administrator of the Active Directory.

Administrator Password

Enter the password of the administrator of the Active Directory.

Directory Server address

This setting is optional. Enter the IP address of the Active Directory server.

Do not cache ADS accounts locally Select this check box to prevent caching of ADS accounts. Caching can speed access, but downloading and updating the accounts of a large domain can also slow the ReadyNAS system. If this check box is clear, then the ReadyNAS system imports a list of users and groups from the Active Directory server. If the option is checked, then the ReadyNAS does not import a list of users and groups from AD.

Select the Export option to export this ReadyNAS system ADS map to a file for later uploading to other ReadyNAS systems.

Note For use with Windows systems, the ReadyNAS maps Windows IDs (Windows SIDS) to ReadyNAS IDs. In versions of ReadyNAS OS previous to ReadyNAS OS 6.5 and in systems upgraded from those earlier versions, the mapping is done when an account is first authenticated.You can import and export this map so that all ReadyNAS systems on a network use the same map.

Starting with ReadyNAS OS 6.5, the mapping is done by an algorithm using the SID. Because the algorithm is the same on all ReadyNAS systems, you do not need to transfer the mapping between systems on the network.

You cannot convert the maps on a ReadyNAS system from one method to the other.

(Optional) Click the Refresh ADS Accounts button.

User and group information about your ReadyNAS system is updated immediately.

For more information about managing users and groups with Active Directory, see your Active Directory documentation.

Keep the following precautions in mind when using Active Directory mode:

â¢

The same time must be set on your Active Directory server and your ReadyNAS system clocks. We recommend that you choose your domain controller as your NTP server to ensure that time settings are the same.

â¢

The DNS server that you use must be able to resolve the host name of the domain controller. We recommend that you point your ReadyNAS to the Active Directory DNS to ensure that host names can be resolved.

â¢

If you do not set the NTP server, the ReadyNAS device will set an NTP server.

Basic Network Concepts

The acronym NAS in ReadyNAS is short for network-attached storage. Your local area network (LAN) is an integral part of managing and using your ReadyNAS storage system. Connecting your ReadyNAS storage system to the Internet expands your ability to access data stored on your ReadyNAS system when you are away from it.

Figure 11. Example home network with ReadyNAS

In most environments, your ReadyNAS storage systemâs default network settings allow you to connect and communicate with your ReadyNAS storage system over your local area network and the Internet. However, you can adjust these settings to accommodate your needs.

MAC Addresses

Every device that uses Ethernet technology is assigned a unique MAC (Media Access Control) address that is used to identify the source device and the destination device. MAC addresses are assigned when a device is manufactured. Your ReadyNAS storage systemâs MAC address is listed on the systemâs label. You can also view it by selecting Network on the local admin page.

IP Addresses

IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are another key component for sharing data over a network. A unique IP

address is assigned to every network-connected device. IP addresses come in two varieties: static and dynamic. Static IP addresses do not change, but dynamic IP addresses do change.

Unlike MAC addresses, IP addresses are not assigned by the deviceâs manufacturer. Static IP addresses are assigned by your ISP (Internet service provider) or network administrator. Dynamic IP addresses are assigned by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) server. In most cases, the DHCP server belongs to an ISP, but a router or other device can also act as a DHCP server.

Ethernet

Your ReadyNAS storage system uses Ethernet technology to transfer information on your local area network.

Ethernet technology divides data into smaller pieces, called packets or frames, before transmitting it on your network. Ethernet technology includes methods to check for data transmission errors.

MTU

You can also configure the maximum size of packets that are sent across a network. This setting is called MTU (maximum transmission unit). A large MTU can help speed data transmission in some circumstances.

However, using a large packet size becomes inefficient if an error occurs during transmission. That is because if any part of a large packet is corrupt, the entire large packet must be resent. If you use a smaller MTU, smaller packets are resent if a communication error occurs.

Your ReadyNAS system supports at least a maximum MTU size of 9214 bytes. (Some models support 9216

bytes.) Use this MTU size only if all components of your network, for example, network interface cards (NICs), hosts, and your switch, support packets of this size or larger.

ReadyNAS OS 6.5

DNS

DNS is short for Domain Name System. Because IP addresses are strings of numbers, they are hard to remember. It is easier to remember a name (for example, www.netgear.com) than a string of numbers when you want to visit a website. A DNS server translates IP addresses into website names and website names into IP addresses.

If you selected the option to assign an IP address automatically when you configured your Ethernet settings, the DNS fields are populated with the DNS settings from your DHCP server and cannot be edited.

If you selected the option to assign an IP address manually when you configured your Ethernet settings, you must manually specify the IP addresses of the DNS servers and the domain name to access your ReadyNAS system over the Internet.Your network administrator can help you determine your Domain Name Server IP address.

Configure the Ethernet Interfaces

All ReadyNAS systems provide at least one physical Ethernet interface.

On ReadyNAS systems with two or more Ethernet interfaces, the interfaces can be used independently as individual links or combined into a bonded adapter. Bonding can provide redundancy or increased throughput.

For each Ethernet interface, you can configure the following settings:

Configure Bonded Adapters

Creating a bonded adapter is optional. A bonded adapter combines two Ethernet interfaces into a single logical link. Network devices treat the bonded adapter as a single link, which increases fault tolerance and provides load sharing. NETGEAR does not recommend bonding interfaces with different speeds, for example bonding a 1 Gb interface with a 10 Gb interface.

Note Bonding is available only on ReadyNAS systems with two or more Ethernet interfaces.

System Settings

156

ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Teaming Modes

The ReadyNAS supports several teaming modes. Both the ReadyNAS and the device with which the bonded adapter is linked must support the same teaming mode. The available teaming modes are described in the following table.

Table 9. Teaming mode descriptions

Teaming Mode

Description

IEEE 802.3ad LACP

Creates aggregation groups that use the same speed and duplex settings. Utilizes all interfaces in the active aggregator according to the 802.3ad specification.You need a switch that supports IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link aggregation.

Active Backup

Only one interface in the bond is active. A different interface becomes active if, and only if, the active interface fails. The bondâs MAC address is externally visible on only one port to avoid confusing the switch. You can decide which interface is active by default.

Transmit Load Balancing Adapter bonding that does not require any special switch support. The outgoing traffic is distributed according to the current load (computed relative to the speed) on each interface.

Incoming traffic is received by the current interface. If the receiving interface fails, another interface takes over the MAC address of the failed receiving interface.

Adaptive Load Balancing Includes transmit load balancing plus receive load balancing for IPV4 traffic and does not require any special switch support. The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP

negotiation.

Round-Robin

Transmit packets in sequential order from the first available interface to the next. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

XOR

Transmit based on the default simple transmit hash policy. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

Broadcast

Transmit everything on all slave interfaces. This mode provides fault tolerance.

Hash Types

If you select the IEEE 802.3ad LACP or the XOR teaming mode, you must select which hash type option you want to use:

â¢

Layer 2

â¢

Layer 2+3 (uses Layer 2 and Layer 3 hash types simultaneously)

Configure Static Routes

You can add and remove static routes. Static routes are not frequently used with ReadyNAS, but a few situations call for them. For example, if no automatically routed path to a device exists that the ReadyNAS

must access, you can define a static path to it.

Before configuring a static route, you must configure the ReadyNAS adapter, its Ethernet address, and subnet mask.

To configure a static route, there must be a gateway between the network the ReadyNAS is on, and the network with the destination address. There is an address for the gateway on the network the ReadyNAS

is on, and there is an address for the gateway on the network the destination address is on. Before configuring the static route, determine the gateway address on the network the ReadyNAS is on. You must also know the target IP address and the subnet mask for the target's network.

As a sample configuration, your ReadyNAS uses separate network connections to connect to the Internet and to a private network, and the default gateway is configured to connect to the Internet. The ReadyNAS

can connect to anything on the private network and on the Internet, but if another private network is connected to the private network, the ReadyNAS cannot automatically find devices on the second private network. For example, one network interface on the ReadyNAS might use the address 10.1.0.1 to connect to a private network with addresses in the range 10.1.xxx.xxx. The 10.1 network connects to a private network with a server with the address 192.168.1.0 and with subnet mask 255.255.255.0. No automatic route exists from the ReadyNAS to the server, but you can specify a static route. For this example, the address 10.1.0.2 is the address of the gateway between the two private networks.

To configure a static route:

1.

Log in to your ReadyNAS admin page.

2.

Select Network > Routes.

The window updates to show the configured routes.

3.

Click the + button.

The New Route page displays.

Configure Global Settings for System Services

File sharing protocols, for example, SMB or NFS, must be enabled for the ReadyNAS. When enabled, some of the protocols can be disabled for specific shares, or require additional configuration settings for individual accounts.

Basic File-Sharing Concepts

Network access to data stored on your ReadyNAS system is managed by file-sharing protocols, which handle the transfer of data. For shares, you can enable several protocols. For LUNs, the protocol is always iSCSI. (iSCSI is enabled by default.)

Global settings for file-sharing protocols apply to your entire ReadyNAS system. Share settings for file-sharing protocols apply to individual shares.

When you enable a file-sharing protocol for an individual shared folder, the protocol is also enabled globally.

When you disable a file-sharing protocol for an individual shared folder, the protocol remains enabled globally so that you can still access other folders that might be using the protocol.

If a protocol is disabled globally, you can configure its settings for individual shares, but the settings are not effective until you enable the protocol. For information about how to configure and enable file-sharing protocols for individual shares, see Set Network Access Rights to Shared Folders on page 55.

For best performance, enable only those file-sharing protocols that you use. Disable the file-sharing protocols that you do not use to maximize system memory and improve system performance. For example, if you do not use Linux or Unix computers to transfer files to and from your ReadyNAS system, disable the NFS

file-sharing protocol.

Enable Wake-on-LAN

Wake-on-LAN is a way to remotely power up a network-attached device, like a computer or storage system.

This feature allows you to conserve power by keeping a device turned off when it is not needed, but allows a remote system to turn it on when it is needed.

System Maintenance

198





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Wake-on-LAN works when one network-attached device sends a signal, called a magic packet, to another network-attached device. If wake-on-LAN is enabled in the target device, the packet signals the device to power up.

Your ReadyNAS system supports wake-on-LAN on the first Ethernet port (LAN 1) only. By default, wake-on-LAN is not enabled.

To enable wake-on-LAN:

1.

Log in to your ReadyNAS.

2.

Select System > Power.

3.

If not already expanded, expand Wake On LAN.

4.

Select the Wake On LAN check box.

What Is Disk Spin-Down

Disk spin-down reduces the rotation speed of your ReadyNAS disks. When the disks are spun down, power consumption is reduced, the disks are quieter, and disk life is extended. However, the disks must spin back up before the ReadyNAS can read or write data to them. This can cause an apparent slow down in disk performance and, depending on the application, can cause time-outs.

You can control whether spin-down is used, how long a period of inactivity is needed before disk spin-down, and if used, what days and times it is enabled. If you use spin-down and also use applications that automatically read or write to the disks, either disable spin-down when the applications start writing to the disks, or verify that the disks spin back up fast enough not to cause a time out. It can take up to 10 seconds for disks to spin up. In some file server applications, a 10-second delay might be acceptable. For databases, virtualization, and many applications, the delay might cause the application or host operating system to time out and return an error.

The energy saved depends on model, but a common figure is that a drive uses 5.3W during read/write operations, 3.4W while idle, and only 0.4W while in standby or sleep mode.

Set or Change Disk Spin-Down

Allowing disks to slow or spin down when not being actively used can potentially save power and extend the life of the disks, but this can also slow effective read/write speeds and can make the disks appear to be off-line or cause time outs.

To set or change the disk spin-down settings:

1.

Log in to your ReadyNAS system.

2.

Select System > Power.

The page updates showing the power settings.

We recommend that you physically connect the ReadyNAS to one or more uninterruptible power supply (UPS) devices to protect against data loss due to power failures. Once a UPS is connected, you can use the ReadyNAS local admin page to monitor and manage it.

If you enable email alerts, the ReadyNAS sends a message when the status of a UPS changes. For example, if a power failure forces a UPS into battery mode or if a battery is low, you receive an email message.

When the UPS internal battery voltage drops to the UPS low voltage setting, and the UPS sends a signal to the ReadyNAS, the ReadyNAS automatically shuts down gracefully.

UPS Configurations

The ReadyNAS supports UPS devices managed over SNMP, USB, and over a remote connection.

UPS Devices Managed Over SNMP

An SNMP UPS lets the ReadyNAS query the manufacturer-specific Management Information Base (MIB).

The ReadyNAS monitors the UPS using the SNMP protocol. The Ethernet connection between the UPS

and the ReadyNAS passes through a switch.

UPS Devices Managed Over a Remote Connection

A remote UPS is attached to a remote server, such as a ReadyNAS or a Linux server that is running Network UPS Tools (NUT ). The ReadyNAS monitors and manages the UPS over the remote connection. The Ethernet connection between the UPS and the ReadyNAS passes through a switch.

Manage UPS Devices

You can manually add, edit, and remove UPS devices as well as monitor the status of connected UPS

devices.

Add a UPS

If your UPS is not automatically detected when you connect it to your ReadyNAS system, you must manually add the UPS.

Backup and Recovery

11

Your ReadyNAS system can manage backup and recovery for many devices on your network. For example, you can back up data that is stored on your ReadyNAS storage system to secondary devices, such as a USB

drive. You can also use your ReadyNAS storage system to store backed-up data from other devices, like your laptop.

If your data is important enough to store, it is important enough to back up. Data can be lost due to a number of events, including natural disaster (for example, fire or flood), theft, improper data deletion, and hard drive failure. If you regularly back up your data, you can recover your data if any of these situations occur.

Businesses sometimes use backup data to comply with data retention regulations and to archive information before making major changes to their IT environments, such as batch updates to databases. At home and in business settings, back up important data that might be lost due to a natural disaster or the loss of a device that stores data.

Backup Concepts

A backup is a copy of data that you use if your primary copy is deleted or damaged. The process of storing primary data on a second device is called backing up.

A backup source is the place where you store the primary copy of the data that you want to back up.

A backup destination is the place where you store the backed-up data.

If you store primary copies of your data on your ReadyNAS system, you can create a backup job to back up your data to a secondary device on the same network.

Figure 12. Backing up data from a ReadyNAS system to a secondary device (USB drive) If you store primary copies of your data on your computer or other device, you can create a backup job to back up your data to a ReadyNAS system that is on the same network.

Figure 13. Backing up data from a computer to a ReadyNAS system

A full backup makes a copy of all the data stored on the primary system. Your first backup of a primary system is always a full backup job. The amount of time a full backup takes depends on the amount of stored data.

An incremental backup copies only the data that changed since your last backup process. An incremental backup job takes much less time than a full backup job.

Note RAID configuration of disks is not a substitute for backing up data. RAID configuration protects you from data loss only if a disk fails. For more information about the protection that RAID configuration offers, see RAID on page 22.

Backup and Recovery

207





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

A backup source or destination can be local (stored on the ReadyNAS) or remote (stored somewhere else).

If the backup source or destination is remote, you must select the backup protocol that you want to use (see

Backup Protocols on page 209).

Local options for backup sources and destinations are described in the following table.

Table 12. Local backup sources and destinations

Item

Description

volume: <volume name>

Source or destination is a volume on the

ReadyNAS.

share: <share name>

Source or destination is a shared folder on the

ReadyNAS.

All Home Shares

Source or destination is every userâs home share

on the ReadyNAS.

home: <home share name>

Source or destination is a userâs home share on

the ReadyNAS.

External Storage (<location of Source or destination is connected a USB or connection>)

eSATA port on the ReadyNAS.

Time Machine

Source is the Time Machine data stored locally

on the ReadyNAS.

Recovery Concepts

The process of restoring backed-up data to the device where the primary copy is kept is called recovery.

A recovery source is the place where you store the backed-up data. A recovery destination is the place to which you want to restore the backed-up data. The recovered data replaces a deleted or damaged primary copy.

If you store backed-up data on the ReadyNAS system, you can create a recovery job to restore backed-up data to your computer or other primary device.

Figure 14. Recovering data from a ReadyNAS system to a laptop computer If you store backed-up data on another device on the network, such as a USB drive, you can create a recovery job to restore backed-up data to your ReadyNAS system.

Backup and Recovery

208





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Figure 15. Restoring data from a USB drive to a ReadyNAS system

The ReadyNAS system treats recovery jobs like backup jobs.You use the Backup page to create a recovery job. In a recovery job, you reverse the source and destination that you used when you backed up the data.

The recovery source is the backup destination and the recovery destination is the backup source.

Secure Cloud Backups

A secure cloud backup lets you use online backup and recovery tools, such as ReadyNAS Vault, to save data over the Internet to a remote location and restore the data, if needed. For more information about backing up your data using ReadyNAS Vault, see ReadyNAS Vault on page 141.

Backup Protocols

When you back up data to a remote destination or recover it from a remote source, data is transferred over a network using file-sharing protocols.

You can select which protocol you want to use for the job. The options that are available to you depend on how your ReadyNAS system is configured. Backup protocols are described in the following table.

Table 13. Backup protocols

Item

Description

Windows/NAS (Timestamp) Source or destination is a share on a Windows computer, or a share on another NAS.

Incremental backups with this protocol use time stamps to determine whether files will be backed up.

Windows (Archive Bit)

Source is a share on a Windows computer.

Incremental backups with this protocol use the archive bit of files, similar to Windows, to determine whether they will be backed up.

FTP

Source or destination is an FTP site or a path from that site.

NFS

Source or destination is on a Linux or UNIX device accessed using NFS.

Mac OS X users can also use this option by setting up an NFS share from the console terminal.

Backup and Recovery

209





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Table 13. Backup protocols (Continued)

Item

Description

Rsync server

Source or destination is accessed using an Rsync server.

Rsync was originally available for Linux and other UNIX-based operating systems, but is also popular under Windows and Mac for its efficient use of incremental file transfers. Using Rsync is the preferred backup method when backing up from one ReadyNAS device to another.

Rsync over Remote SSH

Source or destination is accessed using an Rsync server.

Rsync data transfers to go through a secure, encrypted SSH tunnel. We recommend using remote SSH when backups are being transferred over the Internet.

Backup Job Recommendations

By default, all backup jobs are scheduled to run every day. You can edit these settings after you create each backup job. For more information, see Schedule a Backup Job on page 224.

The first few times you back up data, it is a good practice to perform the backup manually. With a manual backup, you can make sure that access is granted to the remote backup source or destination and see how long the backup takes to run. You must know how long the backup job takes so that you can allow enough time in the schedule for it to complete before you schedule the next backup. You can run a manual backup after you create each backup job. For more information, see Manually Start a Backup or Recovery Job on page 228.

Note Backup and recovery jobs using Time Machine use different procedures. For more information, see Time Machine on page 233.

Manage Backup and Recovery Jobs

You can create, configure and delete backup and recovery jobs. You can also manually start jobs and clear the job log.

Back Up A Camera or Other Media Device

Many cameras and other media devices support the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) and the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP). You can configure your ReadyNAS to backup such devices when you connect them to the ReadyNAS.

Your camera or other MTP supporting device must have MTP or PTP enabled before connecting it your ReadyNAS. Check your device documentation.

After enabling MTP backups, when you connect your device to the ReadyNAS with a USB cable, the ReadyNAS automatically backups up the device.

Note Recent versions of iOS and Android OS require you to authorize the ReadyNAS to access the device when you first connect them.

To enable automatic MTP or PTP backs:

1.

Log in to the ReadyNAS.

Time Machine

You can use Mac OS X Time Machine and your ReadyNAS storage system to back up and retrieve data for your Mac computer. This combines the ease of a native Mac backup with the space and reliability of your ReadyNAS.

Starting in ReadyNAS OS 6.2, in addition to a shared Time Machine that can be used by any Mac account, you can also configure individual accounts to use their own private Time Machines. An account can use the shared Time Machine or its private Time Machine, but not both. A shared Time Machine and private Time Machines can exist on the same ReadyNAS.

Backup and Recovery

233





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

When configuring a shared Time Machine, you set up a specific user name and password. All users of the shared Time Machine use this user name and password when connecting from Time Machine on the Mac.

All users of the shared Time Machine are allowed equal access to all data in the shared Time Machine.

An account using a private Time Machine must exist on the ReadyNAS. You can configure an existing ReadyNAS account to use a private Time Machine, or add the account directly in the Private Time Machine section of the Time Machine page (Backup > Time Machine). The space for a private Time Machine is part of the account's home folder and is invisible to other users of the ReadyNAS.

Back Up Your Mac Using a Shared Time Machine

You can use your ReadyNAS as the disk for Time Machine backups. ReadyNAS OS supports two different types of Time Machine targets, a single Time Machine shared by several users, and private Time Machines used by individual users. Use this procedure for a shared Time Machine.

Before performing these steps, verify that the AFP protocol is enabled on your ReadyNAS. Note that it is enabled by default.

To back up data on your Mac to your ReadyNAS system using Time Machine: 1.

Log in to your ReadyNAS.

2.

Select Backup > Time Machine.

3.

If the Shared Time Machine Enable slide switch is not already set to On, set it to On.

4.

Change the default user name and password.

The default user name is ReadyNAS and the default password is the login password for the ReadyNAS.

You use these credentials later when connecting to the ReadyNAS from the Mac.

5.

In the Capacity field, enter the maximum amount of space on your ReadyNAS storage system that you want to devote to Time Machine backups.

Backup and Recovery

234





ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Note The first time you run Time Machine on your Mac, a sparse bundle is created on your ReadyNAS to store the backup data. The maximum size of the sparse bundle is the size that you specify in the Capacity field. Make sure that you allocate more space than is needed so that the sparse bundle can accommodate additional data later.

If you want to increase the size of the sparse bundle, you must delete the sparse bundle and create a new Time Machine backup. (See Increase Your Time Machine

Backup Capacity on page 237.) After you run Time Machine for the first time, simply changing the number in the Capacity field does not increase the size of the sparse bundle.

6.

Click the Apply button.

Your settings are saved.

7.

On your Mac OS X computer, launch Time Machine.

The Time Machine window opens.

8.

Click the Add or Remove Backup Disk button.

A pop-up window lists available disks, including your ReadyNAS system.

9.

Select the disk named timemachine.

The other disks are possible private Time Machine disks.

10. Click the Use Disk button.

11. When prompted, in the Name and Password fields, enter ReadyNAS or the shared Time Machine user name and password that you created in step 4 on page 234.

12. Click the Connect button.

Time Machine begins the backup, which can take several minutes to start.

Back Up Your Mac Using a Private Time Machine

You can use your ReadyNAS as the disk for Time Machine backups. ReadyNAS OS supports two different types of Time Machine targets, a single Time Machine shared by several users, and private Time Machines used by individual users. Use this procedure for a private Time Machine.

Before performing these steps, verify that the AFP protocol is enabled on your ReadyNAS. Note that it is enabled by default.

Increase Your Shared Time Machine Backup Capacity

The first time you run a Time Machine backup on your Mac, a sparse bundle (a Mac OS file system directory type) is created on your ReadyNAS to store the backup data. The maximum size of the sparse bundle is the size that you specify when you enable Time Machine on your ReadyNAS. (See Back Up Your Mac Using

Time Machine on page 234.)

After you run Time Machine for the first time, the size of the sparse bundle that stores your Mac backup data is fixed. If you want to increase the size of the sparse bundle, you must delete the sparse bundle and create a new Time Machine backup.

To increase the capacity of the Time Machine backup on your ReadyNAS: 1.

Ensure that the AFP file-sharing protocol is enabled on your ReadyNAS system.

For more information, see Configure Global Settings for File-Sharing Protocols on page 163.

2.

In Finder, select Go > Connect to Server.

The Connect to Server dialog box displays.

3.

Enter the following command in the Server Address field:

afp://<hostname>

<hostname> is the name that you assigned to your ReadyNAS system or the default host name if you did not change it.

Note If you cannot access the ReadyNAS using its host name, try entering afp://<ReadyNAS

IP address> instead. <ReadyNAS IP address> is the IP address of the ReadyNAS.
