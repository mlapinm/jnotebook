NETGEAR ReadyNAS 102

15





ReadyNAS OS 6 Desktop Storage Systems

â¢

If the system was powered on at the time of the power failure, the system powers on when the power supply is restored.

â¢

If the system was powered off at the time of the power failure, the system remains off when the power supply is restored.

Boot Menu

Use the boot menu to restart or troubleshoot your ReadyNAS storage system. Your storage system has the following boot modes:

â¢

Normal. Initiates a normal boot process, just like booting using the Power button.

â¢

Factory default. Initiates a short disk test that takes approximately 5 minutes. After the disk test, a 10-minute time-out period begins.

WARNING:

The factory default reboot process resets the storage system to factory settings, erases all data, resets all defaults, and reformats the disk to X-RAID.

-

If you want to cancel the factory default process, power off the storage system before the 10-minute time-out ends. The system powers down safely without causing any data loss.

-

If you want to reset the system to factory default settings, do not power off your system. After the 10-minute time-out period, the factory default process begins.

Tip: To start the factory default process immediately, press the Backup button during the 10-minute time-out period.

â¢

OS reinstall. Reinstalls the firmware from the internal flash to the disks. Use the OS

reinstall boot mode when the system crashes and corrupts some configuration files. OS

reinstall boot mode also resets some settings on your storage system, such as Internet protocol settings and the administrator password, to defaults.

â¢

Tech support. Boots into a low-level diagnostic mode. Use the tech support boot mode only when a NETGEAR technical support representative instructs you to do so.

â¢

Volume read only. Mounts a volume as read-only. Use this option when you are attempting to rescue data off a disk during a disaster recovery.

â¢

Memory test. Performs a memory test. The pass or fail result is reported using the storage systemâs LEDs. Contact a NETGEAR technical support representative to interpret memory test results.

â¢

Test disk. Performs an offline full disk test. This process can take four hours or more, depending on the size of your disks. Any problems are reported in the system logs. For more information about viewing the system logs, see the ReadyNAS OS 6 Software Manual, which is available at support.netgear.com/product/ReadyNAS-OS6.

Supported Disks

Use only supported SATA hard disk drives (HDD) or solid state drives (SSD) in your ReadyNAS storage system. If you use disks that are not supported, NETGEAR technical support will not provide assistance. For a list of supported disks, see the NETGEAR

Hardware Compatibility List at netgear.com/readynas-hcl.

Previously Formatted Disks

This section describes how to use previously formatted disks with your ReadyNAS OS 6

storage system.

Previously formatted disks must appear on the NETGEAR Hardware Compatibility List, which is available at netgear.com/readynas-hcl.

Reformat Previously Formatted Disks

If you want to use disks that were previously formatted for an operating system other than ReadyNAS OS 6 (for example, Windows or RAIDiator), you must reformat the disks.

If you want to use disks from another ReadyNAS OS 6 storage system, see Migrate a

Volume on page 113.

Note: If you try to use previously formatted disks in a system that does not contain any other disks, the system does not boot and ReadyCLOUD

does not discover your device. If you use RAIDar to discover your device, RAIDar displays a âCorrupt Rootâ error message. ï 

ï 

If you try to use previously formatted disks in a system that already contains usable disks, the system does not reformat or use the previously formatted disks. Any data on the previously formatted disk remains intact.

The following instructions describe how to reformat previously formatted disks in a ReadyNAS OS 6 system. This procedure assumes that the system does not contain any other disks.

ï To reformat previously formatted disks with a diskless ReadyNAS OS 6 system: 1. Gracefully shut down the storage system.

For information about how to gracefully shut down your system, see the Preferred Shutdown section of the chapter that describes your system.

2. Install the disks.

Disks

112





ReadyNAS OS 6 Desktop Storage Systems For more information, see Add a Disk on page 114.

3. Reset the system to its factory default settings.

WARNING:

This process erases all data and reformats all disks into a single X-RAID volume. If you want to preserve the data on the disks, you must back up the data to an external drive before using the disks in your ReadyNAS storage system.

For information about how to reset the system to its factory default settings, see the Boot Menu section of the chapter that describes your system.

The disk is reformatted and becomes available for use with your ReadyNAS OS 6

storage system.

Migrate a Volume

You can migrate a volume from one ReadyNAS OS 6 storage system to another, as long as you migrate every disk in the volume. For example, if you want to migrate a volume that contains two disks, you must add both disks to the new system. If you add only part of a volume to the new system, the system recognizes the disk as a degraded volume.

If your ReadyNAS storage system is operating with one or more disks, you can add disks while the system is running. The new system recognizes the migrated volume and its data.

For more information about adding a disk while the system is running, see Add a Disk on

page 114.

If your ReadyNAS storage system does not have any disks installed, perform the following procedure.

ï To migrate a volume to a diskless ReadyNAS OS 6 system: 1. Gracefully shut down the new (diskless) storage system.

For information about how to gracefully shut down your system, see the Preferred Shutdown section of the chapter that describes your system.

2. Remove each disk in the volume from the old system.

3. Install each disk in the volume into the new storage system.

For more information, see Add a Disk on page 114.

4. Turn on the new system by pressing the Power button.

The new system recognizes the migrated volume and its data.

10. If necessary, turn on your system by pressing the Power button.

If the disk that you added was not previously formatted, the system uses the disk in one of the following ways:

â¢

If you are adding the disk to a system that uses X-RAID, the system automatically determines whether the disk is used for protection or storage. The new disk is incorporated in the background while you continue to use your system.

â¢

If you are adding the disk to a system that uses Flex-RAID, the disk becomes available for use. You use the local admin page to manually configure the new disk.

For more information about X-RAID, Flex-RAID, and using the local admin page, see the ReadyNAS OS 6 Software Manual, which is available at

support.netgear.com/product/ReadyNAS-OS6.

Replace a Disk

If your volumes use a protected RAID configuration, your system can recover from the failure of a disk. When you replace the failed disk, the system rebuilds the volume using the new disk and no data from the volume is lost.

The Disk LEDs can help you identify a failed disk. For more information, see the Status Information section of the chapter that describes your system. You can also use the local admin page to set up email alerts that notify you when a disk fails. In addition, the local admin page provides information about the failed disk.

For information about RAID configurations, setting up email alerts, and using the local admin page, see the ReadyNAS OS 6 Software Manual, which is available at

support.netgear.com/product/ReadyNAS-OS6.

ReadyNAS supports hot-swap drive bays, so you do not need to power down your storage system when replacing a disk.

If you are replacing a disk with a previously formatted disk, see the instructions in Previously

Formatted Disks on page 112.

WARNING:

Replace one disk at a time. Wait for the volume to resynchronize your data before replacing another disk. If you attempt to replace more than one disk at a time, the system will crash.

ReadyNAS OS 6 Desktop Storage Systems

Safety Warnings

â¢

The equipment contains no operator access areas and is certified for installation only by trained personnel, according to the installation instructions provided with each storage system.

â¢

Install the socket-outlet near the equipment in an easily accessible location.

â¢

Observe the on-board battery precautions.

DANGER:

Risk of explosion if battery is replaced by an incorrect type. Dispose of used batteries according to their instructions.

â¢

Connect the storage systems and their associated LAN connections only to equipment within the same building.

Electrical Safety Precautions

Follow basic electrical safety precautions to protect yourself from harm and the ReadyNAS

from damage:

â¢

Be aware of the locations of the power on/off switch on the chassis as well as the roomâs emergency power-off switch, disconnection switch, or electrical outlet. If an electrical accident occurs, you can then quickly remove power from the system.

â¢

Do not work alone when working with high-voltage components.

â¢

Always disconnect power from the system when removing or installing main system components, such as the main board or memory modules. When disconnecting power, first power down the system with the operating system and then unplug the power cords of all the power supply storage systems in the system.

â¢

When working around exposed electrical circuits, ensure that another person who is familiar with the power-off controls is nearby to switch off the power if necessary.

â¢

Use only one hand when working with powered-on electrical equipment. This is to avoid making a complete circuit, which will cause electrical shock. Use extreme caution when using metal tools, which can easily damage any electrical components or circuit boards they come into contact with.

â¢

Do not use mats designed to decrease static electrical discharge as protection from electrical shock. Instead, use rubber mats that have been specifically designed as electrical insulators.

â¢

Use only power supply cords that include a grounding plug and plug them into grounded electrical outlets.

ReadyNAS OS 6 Desktop Storage Systems

General Safety Precautions

Follow these rules to ensure general safety:

â¢

Keep the area around the ReadyNAS clean and free of clutter.

â¢

See the technical specifications in this manual for details about your specific ReadyNAS

storage systems.

â¢

Replace the on-board battery only with the same battery or an equivalent type of battery recommended by the manufacturer. Dispose of used batteries according to the manufacturerâs instructions.

DANGER:

Installing the battery upside down reverses its polarities and creates a danger of explosion.

â¢

Only trained service technicians can replace the soldered-in self-resetting PTC (positive temperature coefficient) fuses on the main board, using only new fuses that are the same as or equivalent to the ones being replaced. Contact technical support for details and support.

Electrostatic Discharge Precautions

Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is generated by two objects with different electrical charges coming into contact with each other. An electrical discharge is created to neutralize this difference, which can damage electronic components and printed circuit boards. The following measures are generally sufficient to neutralize this difference before contact is made to protect your equipment from ESD:

â¢

Use a grounded wrist strap designed to prevent static discharge.

â¢

Keep all components and printed circuit boards (PCBs) in their antistatic bags until ready for use.

â¢

Touch a grounded metal object before removing the board from the antistatic bag.

â¢

Do not let components or PCBs come into contact with your clothing, which might retain a charge even if you are wearing a wrist strap.

â¢

Handle a board by its edges only; do not touch its components, peripheral chips, memory modules, or contacts.

â¢

When handling chips or modules, avoid touching their pins.

â¢

Put the main board and peripherals back into their antistatic bags when not in use.

â¢

For grounding purposes, make sure your computer chassis provides excellent conductivity between the power supply, the case, the mounting fasteners, and the main board.
