ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Five Levels of Protection

File and data protection strategies such as various RAID levels or snapshots can go only so far in protecting data from loss, but ReadyNAS OS provides five separate strategies that work together to provide substantially better protection than any one strategy.

The different levels of disk redundancy provided by RAID types provide degrees of file protection from the loss of one or more disks, but cannot do anything about accidental deletion or corruption; can mask, but not prevent, gradual corruption caused by the slow degradation of the disks; and cannot provide protection from a site disaster. Snapshot technologies provide protection against accidental deletion or corruption but by themselves cannot protect against disk loss or site loss.

ReadyNAS OS allows you to use five different types of protection simultaneously:

â¢

RAID. Protects against disk failure.

â¢

Snapshot technology. Protects against accidental data deletion or corruption by providing point-in-time recovery.

â¢

Real-time antivirus. Protects against loss or corruption from viruses.

â¢

Bit rot protection. Protects against the degradation of data from disk aging.

â¢

Offsite backup. Protects against site loss.

Volume Configuration

This chapter describes how to configure and manage the volumes in your ReadyNAS storage system. It includes the following sections:

Basic Volume and RAID Concepts

â¢

ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Basic Volume and RAID Concepts

To get the most out of your ReadyNAS storage system, it is helpful to understand the basics of volumes and RAID. Understanding these concepts is the first step to making good decisions about how to configure, manage, and use your ReadyNAS storage system.

Volumes

In the most general sense, volumes are data storage devices. Your computer treats an internal hard drive as a volume. It also treats a portable USB thumb drive as a volume.

Volumes can be either physical or logical. Usually, the term physical volume refers to a hard disk drive.

When this term is used in this way, a two-bay storage system can be made up of up to two physical volumes (hard disk drives). A four-bay storage system can be made up of up to four physical volumes. A six-bay storage system can be made up of up to six physical volumes.

The term logical volume refers to the way that you divide, or partition, your storage space. For example:

â¢

Each logical volume can correspond to a hard disk drive.

â¢

A logical volume can be made up of more than one hard disk drive.

In this manual, the term volume refers to a logical volume. The terms hard disk drive and disk refer to a physical volume.

RAID

Your ReadyNAS storage system allows you to configure your hard disks using one of the many RAID

technologies.

RAID is short for redundant array of independent disks. RAID is a storage technology that balances data protection, system performance, and storage space by determining how the storage system distributes data.

Many different ways of distributing data are standardized into various RAID levels. Each RAID level offers a tradeoff of data protection, system performance, and storage space. For example, one RAID level might improve data protection but reduce storage space. Another RAID level might increase storage space but also reduce system performance.

Your ReadyNAS storage system supports X-RAIDâ¢ mode, a proprietary single-volume RAID architecture that is easy to administer, and Flex-RAID mode, which allows you to format your disks in a variety of industry-standard RAID levels.

When you power on your system for the first time or if you reset your system to its factory default settings, the optimal RAID mode and level are automatically selected for you based on the number of disks that are installed. You can also configure the RAID settings manually (see Change RAID Mode on page 25).

X-RAID

X-RAID is an autoexpandable RAID technology that is available only on ReadyNAS systems. With X-RAID, you do not need to know intricate details about RAID to administer your system. X-RAID allows you to add storage space without reformatting your drives or moving your data to another location. Because the expansion happens online, you can continue to use your ReadyNAS system while the volume capacity increases.

Volume Configuration

22



ReadyNAS OS 6.5

Because X-RAID is a single-volume architecture, if you configure your hard disk drives to use X-RAID, your storage system includes only one volume that is made up of all installed hard disk drives. X-RAIDâs single-volume architecture provides two major advantages:

â¢

Easy system management

â¢

Auto expansion

Adding disks to a Flex-RAID formatted system is more complex. Disks must be added in ways compatible with the RAID level, or you must back up the data to another system, add a disk, reformat the RAID volume, and restore the data to the new RAID volume. With X-RAID, none of those administrative tasks are required.

Instead, with X-RAID, your volume automatically expands to accommodate additional disks or larger-capacity disks.

With X-RAID, you can start out with one hard disk, add a second disk for data protection, and add more disks for additional storage capacity. X-RAID accommodates the new disks automatically. You can replace existing disks with larger-capacity disks and X-RAID automatically accommodates the new disks.

X-RAID requires a minimum of two hard disks to provide protection against disk failure. If you use a one-disk ReadyNAS storage system and want protection from disk failure, you must add a second disk that is at least as large as the first. It can be added while the system is running.

X-RAID uses the capacity of one disk for data storage and reserves the capacity of a second disk for data protection, which allows the volume to recreate data if a disk fails. In a two-disk system, the usable storage space is one disk. In a three-disk system, the usable storage space is two disks. In general, the total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of all your disks minus the capacity of one disk.

The following figure illustrates how X-RAID uses new disks.

1.

The first disk that you install is used for initial (unprotected) storage space.

2.

The second disk that you install is reserved for data protection (parity information).

3.

Installing additional disks increases your storage space.

Note X-RAID reserves the capacity of one disk for data protection. The actual space reserved for data protection is distributed across all disks.

Flex-RAID

NETGEARâs Flex-RAID technology allows you to choose from among several industry-standard RAID levels:

â¢

JBOD. This most basic RAID level does not protect your data from loss if one of your drives fails. JBOD

is available only on volumes consisting of a single hard disk.

â¢

RAID 0. RAID 0 distributes data across multiple disks, resulting in improved disk performance compared to systems that do not use RAID formatting. The total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of the smallest of your disk drives times the number of disks. RAID 0 is available on volumes consisting of two or more hard disks.

â¢

RAID 1. This RAID level provides full redundancy of your data, because it duplicates data across multiple disks. Exactly the same data is stored on two or more disks at all times. RAID 1 protects your data from loss if one disk fails. The total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of your smallest disk.

â¢

RAID 5. This RAID level also provides data redundancy, but it requires at least three disks. RAID 5 uses the capacity of one disk to protect you from data loss if one disk fails. Your data is distributed across multiple disks to improve disk performance. The total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of all your disks minus the capacity of one disk. It is supported on systems with at least four drive bays.

â¢

RAID 6. This RAID level provides recovery from the loss of two disks. Your data is distributed across multiple disks to improve disk performance. The total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of all your disks minus the capacity of two disks. It is supported on systems with at least four drive bays.

â¢

RAID 10 (or 1+0). This RAID level uses both RAID 1 and RAID 0 technology. First, your data is duplicated so that exactly the same data is stored on two or more disks. Then the data is distributed across additional disks to improve disk performance. It is supported on systems with at least four drive bays.

â¢

RAID 50 (or 5+0). This RAID level uses both RAID 5 and RAID 0 technology. First, a disk is used to provide redundancy. Then your data is distributed across multiple disks to improve disk performance.

A minimum of six disks are required. The total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of all your disks minus the capacity of two disks.

â¢

RAID 60 (or 6+0). This RAID level uses both RAID 6 and RAID 0 technology. First, two disks are used to provide redundancy. Then your data is distributed across multiple disks to improve disk performance.

A minimum of eight disks are required. The total capacity of your storage system equals the capacity of all of your disks minus the capacity of four disks.

The Flex-RAID levels that you can select depend on the number of disks included in the volume. The following table describes the Flex-RAID levels that are available for a given number of disks. It also indicates whether adding a disk for data protection is possible for each configuration.

RAID 50

No, but you can add two disks. (The additional disks provide dual redundancy and converts the volume to RAID 60.)

8 or more

RAID 60

No. (Volume is already protected with dual redundancy.)

Manage Volumes

You can manage volumes on your ReadyNAS system. You can add or delete volumes from the system.

Additionally, you can change the volumeâs RAID mode and level, check volume status, perform volume maintenance, and configure volume protection.You can also extend the storage capacity on you ReadyNAS

system.

Change RAID Mode

You can change the RAID mode that your ReadyNAS storage system uses. By default, your systemâs hard disks are configured into a single X-RAID volume.

Change From X-RAID to Flex-RAID

Your ReadyNAS system can easily change a volume from X-RAID to Flex-RAID mode. Data on the X-RAID

volume is preserved when you switch to Flex-RAID. The RAID level of the resulting Flex-RAID volume is automatically assigned based on the number of disks that are installed.

Volume Configuration

To change from X-RAID to Flex-RAID:

1.

Log in to the ReadyNAS.

2.

Select System > Volumes.

3.

Click the X-RAID button at the right side of the page.

4.

Confirm that you want to switch from X-RAID to Flex-RAID.

The volume switches from X-RAID mode to Flex-RAID mode and the indicator on the X-RAID button turns gray.

The RAID level is automatically assigned based on the number of disks that are installed.

Change From Flex-RAID to X-RAID

If your system contains only one volume, you can easily switch from Flex-RAID to X-RAID. Data on the Flex-RAID volume is preserved when you switch to X-RAID.

If your system contains multiple volumes, you must first reconfigure your disks into a single volume.

Note When you switch to X-RAID mode, any extra disks installed in your system are automatically reformatted and used for storage expansion.You cannot change the RAID mode of a RAID 0 or RAID 10 volume.

The volume switches from Flex-RAID mode to X-RAID mode and the indicator on the X-RAID button turns green.

Any available drives are automatically used for storage expansion.

Change to a Different Flex-RAID Level

In Flex-RAID mode, you assign one of several RAID levels to your volume. Available RAID levels depend on the number of disks that you want the volume to include. For more information, see Flex-RAID on page 24. You can reconfigure your volumes to use a different RAID level.

Note Changing the RAID level of a volume erases all data. If data is stored on your system, you must back up the data to another storage device before changing the RAID level.

To change to RAID levels:

1.

Log in to your ReadyNAS.

2.

If any data is stored on the volumes that you want to reconfigure, back up your data.

3.

Delete the volumes that you want to reconfigure (see Delete a Volume on page 33).

The disks that were part of the volumes become available again for other purposes (the color of the disks turns black).

4.

Create a new volume from the available disks and select the RAID level (see Create and Encrypt a

Volume on page 31).

The volume is formatted according to your specifications. Formatting can take quite a while, depending on the size of your hard disk drives.

Note The disks are listed by their position in the enclosure: < column>x< row>. For example, Disk 3X1 is the third disk from the left in the top row of the enclosure.

Configure the Checksum Function

Checksum functions help detect data transmission errors. The ReadyNAS uses a checksum function to improve accuracy and consistency when writing data to a volume. You can enable or disable the checksum function on each volume. Enabling the checksum function improves the integrity of your data but reduces performance speeds.

Bit rot protection uses the checksum functions to detect a read error. For information and bit rot protection,

see Bit Rot Protection on page 47.

Enable or disable the checksum function:

1.

Log in to your ReadyNAS.

2.

Select System > Volumes.

3.

Select one of the volumes listed on the left side of the page.

Create and Encrypt a Volume

During volume creation you can also enable volume encryption. Encryption is optional. When encryption is enabled, data is encrypted in real time as it is written to the volume. You cannot encrypt existing volumes.

Encryption is possible only when you are creating new volumes. When created, the volume will be a Flex-RAID

volume, but after you create it, you can change it to an X-RAID volume.
