Strings form the parameters of our program, like string wrapped around a package|Строки формируют параметры нашей программы, как строка, обернутая вокруг пакета||||
Strings are a sequence of symbols, so we can think of each characters being strung together, like beads in a necklace.|Строки - это последовательность символов, поэтому мы можем думать о том, что каждый символ нанизан вместе, как бусины в ожерелье.||||
Strings represent different musical intervals, like the strings on a violin.|Струны представляют собой различные музыкальные интервалы, как струны на скрипке.||||
Strings connect two pieces of code, like sheets of cloth sewn together with string.|Струны соединяют два фрагмента кода, как листы ткани, сшитые вместе с нитью.||||

Fill in the Blank: Control structures, such as ___, allow for ___ to be altered during the execution of a program.

Control structures, such as `conditionals`, allow for `control flow` to be altered during the execution of a program.

#### Define control flow.
The condition that must be met to execute a conditional statement.


`The order of execution in a program.`


A program.


A structure used to alter the order of execution in a program.

#### One of these “programs” uses a conditional control structure. Which one is it?


`“If some condition is met, then do X. Otherwise, do Y.”`


“Do steps A, B, C. If an error occurs, stop, and do steps J, K, L.”


“Do something Z number of times” or “do something repeatedly until some condition is met.”

#### Which of these best describes a loop?


A control structure that repeats a set of instructions UNTIL a specified condition is met.


A control structure that executes a set of instructions IF a specified condition is true.


A control structure that executes a set of instructions UNLESS an error occurs.

#### Which of these best describes an exception control structure?


`A set of instructions is executed. If an exception occurs, that set’s execution is stopped and a second set of instructions is executed.`


A set of instructions is executed repeatedly until an exception occurs.


A set of instructions is repeated if an error occurs during its execution.

#### Lists
LESSON
Learn how to use the the list data type to store and edit ordered data.

Exercises

1. Introduction to Lists

2. Accessing List Items

3. Adding Items to a List

4. Removing Items from a List

5. Lists: Putting it Together

6. Lists: Review

```
// Build a list
comicStrip = ['Codey sees the trail', 'Codey starts the hike', 'Codey is halfway', 'Codey reaches the finish']

// select the 4th item from the list
// and save it to the variable selection
selection = comicStrip[3]
```

When we add something to the end of a list, that’s known as:


Popping


`Appending`


Slicing

Lists are a data structure. They are important in programming because:


They are unordered and random.


`They are ordered and sequential.`


Can only contain one item.

#### Loops
LESSON
Learn about loops: what they are, why programmers use them, and where they use them.

Exercises

1. Introduction to Loops

2. For Loops

3. While Loops

4. For Each Loops

5. Putting it All Together

6. Review

```
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  placeTile('mint')
  placeTile('orange')
  placeTile('mint')
}


let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  placeTile('mint')
  placeTile('orange')
  placeTile('mint')
  i++
}
```

Select the most accurate statement about loops.


Loops are only useful when the number of repetitions is known.


Loops are not useful!


An iteration is made up of multiple loops.


`Loops require less coding and are easier to read than repeated lines of code.`



In programming, each execution of a loop is called a(n)…


Condition


Collection


List


Iteration



What type of loop is used in this program? “While there are slices of pizza left, eat a slice of pizza.”


`While (condition-controlled) loop`


For each (collection-controlled) loop


For (count-controlled) loop



What type of loop is used in this program? “Brush up and down for each tooth in your mouth.”


While (condition-controlled) loop


For (count-controlled) loop


`For each (collection-controlled) loop`
