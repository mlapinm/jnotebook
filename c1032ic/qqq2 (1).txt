no when we continue to talk about the path selection there's a number of tables that we need to be aware of and so we're looking at this from the point of view of router c when we advertise and if that anybody who is and that's how we discover one of the first tables we create as a neighbor table the reason for that is that and think about it this way like I assigned to say and that way if I learn about a route is not there anymore anyway so that we have that we know the interface that we connected to them on with that multicast address then I just talked about the 2240010 now from there each neighbor is always going to be directly connected they'll never be another router between me and a neighbor on the side to be able to get from one or the other now what we're going to do is we're going to exchange routes between each other and that's where we're going to create the topology table not all of the routes somebody tells me about we're going to be the best routes in fact what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at those I'm going to choose the best route out of all of my neighbors to any destination so every destination in this case the 10111 network too many ones again it's going to be the successor route why it had the best metric what was that metric advertised it took a thousand to get there told it to me and I realized it took a thousand for me to get there so that was 2000 router b said it takes advertised 1500 to get there I still have to add the 1000 to get there so it's the second best one now the other thing I told you that there was a backup route a backup route is the thing called the feasible to be a feasible successor this is an important aspect is that administrative distance I shouldn't say the admin istrative advertise distance to be lower than my best distance that I had before total distance feasible distance FD if it's not then it means that I might have been going through loop if the advertised distance is worse than my best distance ever that mean I went through another router to come back here and then take that path to get to my destination yeah it could very well admit that so that's how we get a feasible successor if that administrative business is not better than the route even though it's in my topology table will never become a feasible successor and then well actually it could at some point if we find out after everything's been updated and everyone's talk to each other that maybe that is the only route then it could be but it's not automatic that's for that fast convergence I was talking about and then of course we take all the successor routes and those are the ones that become the routes in the routing table and so that's basically the topology table through that we got the successor maybe feasible successor best route successor route goes into the routing table and that's what we use for all the packets that are received by the router to look to see if we're going to route him to those destinations eigrp has
