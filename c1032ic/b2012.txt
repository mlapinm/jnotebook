So let take a look first how to implement eigrp

the goal for any Dynamic routing protocol is for routers to be able exchange information between them and learn about destinations that are not directly connected those routers

I so as would say it's about the discovery every networks
many times people call this routing by rumor 

Is this think about it one router a long ways away says hey I'm connected to this network let me tell you about him that router says hey I heard about my way to get here and then I heard about another way to get here but it's hopefully a reliable rumor that we get

Now we also you have to have something that maintains the routing information as up-to-date in other words of a destination is no longer available 5 routers away 

I expect that router to tell us through a removal message that we can no longer get to that destination so everyone knows to find A New Path if one becomes available to get to that same destination 

Now is that how to know to choose the best path because in today is routed networks you may have very closely than a full match of connections between routers any of that from any one point of my network 

I mind be able two or three or five paths to the same destination 

which of those is the best one

kind of again the idea of driving down a freeway 

I travel a lot and so without GPS I'd be in trouble 

but I certainly in the old days could look at a map and say okay 

I can get from here to the grocery store 

I'm going to take this freeway for 10 miles to turn off the exit I should see it on my right 

and what happens when that freeway 70 is closed to a car crash or construction 

now I'm stuck 

I don't know any other way to get there 

and so that's another thing that we see would be synonym of protocols 

as they maintain all that information 

so they're like the local person that says 

oh I just got hit by the construction 

I'll take this other exit take a service tree down there no problem 

so they need to know how to find the best path not just a single path 

and to be able to find is I just said the new best path if the current path is no longer available 

so let's take a look at dynamic routing protocols 

and how they behave differently 

first we're going to start with the type 

whether it's an igp interrogate with protocol versus an EGP or an exterior kit with protocol 

we're only focusing on igps in our course 

but let me first talk a little bit about the EGP the exterior protocols 

of one the only one that we commonly use is called bgp the border gateway protocol version 4 

the goal is if you think about how the internet is put together with different service providers that have their customers connected to their networks 

they want to advertise the routes to their customers so that all other people in the world will know how to get to their customers as part of the service or paying for 


but if you think about it 

you don't want to let service provider 'A' be able to tell service provider 'B' how to route 

we just want to tell you about the existence of the routes 

and that's what the egps do in this case bgp

it's a list of routes with suggestions about how to route to those those customers 

in the igp the interior gateway protocol 

it's all about your managed group of routers 

meaning it's your company your enterprise you're the service provider 

they're all under a common management and we often refer to that as an autonomous system 


and what we're doing is we're keeping track of all of the routes that exist inside of our network

without sharing those routes to the people on the outside 

and that's where eigrp and ospf come in their interior gateway protocols 

now another difference is what do they advertise 

one of the igps I didn't mention I was hoping I didn't have to it's called RIP the routing information protocol 

it's an example of a distance vector 

as a distance factor if you think about it I'm asking two questions 

Vector which direction and distance how far 

and once I learned that then I'm good I throw away everything else 

a link takes a little bit different story 

a link state is almost the same as saying interface 

I as a router and just going to tell my neighbors which interfaces I have that are running 

that are up and up and what networks are attached to 

but they can look at basically their map read to your recalculate their way to get to their destination

now what are the other differences between those routes were whether they were classful or classless

what do I mean by that 

if you remember the concept of the variable length subnet mask 

that I took what was maybe a class b address 

and I made subnets out of it 

and then it had to change the class full boundary remember the classroom boundary of the class b 16 bits right 

and so suddenly I might now have a network that looks like it's class b maybe it says 172.16 but then I said. one / 24 what did I do 

I mean it look like a class c but it never was a class C 

remember classfulness is all about that first octet 

so a long way to get to the store a class full routing protocol ignores your subnet mask 

it looks at everything as a class a b or c it doesn't care at all about your subnetting 

which means it might not even know the proper paths to get to those more defined subnets 

a classless routing protocol does look at variable length subnet mask

so if you make the better determination for longest path 

and to help make sure that it doesn't misdirect traffic just because it automatically chopped off your network address to be classful 

rip version one was classful 

igrp by Cisco was classful 

enhanced igrp is a classless or classical protocol your choice 

and ospf is also a classless protocol 

it means we do care about the actual subnet masks 

---- 643

every routing protocol has what we call believability 

hopefully I spelled that correctly 

believe ability means how much do I trust you 

let me go back to my analogy of me being the out of town 

so you you know you have can thanks for the West coast 

now I'm over here on the east coast 

and then we have a local somebody's lived here for 50 years of their lives knows all the roads 

and here comes the complete stranger coming in and asking the question how do you get to the store 

well you know what Ken looked up a route 

I told you that right 

I saw one way of getting there 

and so you can ask him 

and Ken would say you know take exit 14 or whatever 

and he asked the local the local says hey it's 5:00 p.m. don't do what Ken says 

because that's going to be just a parking lot 

and there's construction they already have two lanes that are closed 

so you know it gives me maybe more detail or maybe more believable of an answer 

the question is is which one is a stranger going to use 

so yeah out of town or the guy who's local and do all the details about the routes 

obviously the local would have what we call a better administrative distance and what Ken would have 

and the idea is is whatever administrative distance you gave can 

if you want the local guy to have a better believability index you just have to make the local or the administrative distance slower than you can't 

and that's what administrative does a distance does 


we have a belief that some protocols no more about their environment about your routes 

than do others 

and so that's where we see administrative distances giving to these protocols 

you'll notice that enhanced igrp has a better
or more believable administrative distance than ospf does out of the box 

by the way you can change that anytime you want to 

but it is the belief that eigrp has a better capability of being able to look at the best path then does OSPF 

and I would agree on that 

because ospf looks at only one thing you're going to find out later that it looks only at bandwidth 

whereas erp looks at bandwidth and delay by default 

and does a better calculation on bandwidth than ospf does out of the box 

so that's why we would say eigrp is a little more believable because it's looking at more details about the routes when it's choosing ti's best route to offer
 
---916

let's take a look at some of the features of eigrp 

first of all it has what we call rapid convergence 

rapid means faster than everybody else 

as an example with ospf if a neighbor or to suddenly stop sending its updates 

it would take ospf 40 seconds to realize the neighbor was no longer talking before it would remove the routes and learn from that neighbor and recalculate the new routes to get to assassination 

eigrp automatically keeps track if it is possible of what they call it back up best route 

won't get more specific into the names successor and feasible successor later 

but because of that when you get basically a message of the neighbor's gone 

eigrp is going to immediately all of the other neighbors if you have a better route than my next best route 

and they say no it puts the next best route in 

and it continues on we're talking usually  3 maybe 6 seconds convergence time over the 30 40 seconds or more with ospf 


yeah grp like many other routing protocols can do load balancing with what we call ecmp equal cost multipath 

that means if I have two routes or three routes to the same destination and they have the same cost or metric 

then I'll use all three of them kind of in a round robin some traffic goes one way another different direction as long as it's equal 

now if there's any little difference between them and their metric 

then ospf will no longer load balance 

eigrp will do it what's called an equal  multi-path

which is really cool unique.. 

that means that we can have or else that might not be as good 

but we'll still use them 
I kind of look at ti this way 

when I you know I've got a bunch of kids 

when I go to the grocery store 

I'm going to have bag after bag after bag in the backseat of my SUV and you know 

I'll say to the teenager

I expect you to pick up bags 

help me move this stuff in 

I hope as well 

but I'll even look at the 2 year old 

I know I saw this the other day two year old wanted a bag to carry 

that's unequality path 

it wasn't the best route certainly wasn't the best idea trust me 

but they were still capable of carrying some traffic 

and that's what we do or see if you wanted to be there with eigrp so that's pretty cool as well 

most every protocol has a loop free and is classless routing at least ospf Isis 

I didn't talk about that one as an igp 

and so we expect that 

it's because of the use of the metrics 

if we take the lowest metric 

we're always assuming that is the shortest path and it's a loop free path 

because the higher metrics might have been a loop going to the same router twice

and of course if you think about it 

it doesn't use as much bandwidth for the communications like you might see with other routing protocols 

if they have bounded updates 

and they don't use broadcast traffic which means very few devices are even going to pay attention to the traffic that's being sent out 

they're going to use the multicast to find their neighbors and so that's better than a broadcast 

so those are the features of what 

I hope that you will explore when we look at eigrp

---1241

over the years I've seen this past selection process change how it's represented when we look at training 

but let me just talk about the options here and why are eigrp is considered to be so good 

first of all it uses what's called a metric to find the best path 

now the metric as you'll see later is made up by default of a combination of the bandwidth and the delay on a link and there's more to it it's not just a simple addition I'm saying it uses both of those 

and it comes up with a value 

and so what happens is when we start to look at the how we advertised our information 

we have these things called an advertised distance and reported distance and it all kind of depends on who you're talking to

so let's call this over here router a 

and router a is going to learn about this network 10111 

maybe I had too many ones 1011 there we go 

and and so what this router knows is that it's distance it's reported distance actually what we are looking at here the feasible distance is what we usually used to call it is a thousand 

and now when I advertise that route to my neighbor 


the neighbor says okay you're advertising it has a distance of 1000 

but I know it's going to cost me another thousand just to get to you 

so I'm going to put in there that might feasible distance is going to be 2,000 

what you advertise to me plus what it cost to get there 

as an example I live in a somewhat remote part of the country not a big city by big city people ..

and I used to get this to tell you how long ago was fax is over the fax machine at the office it said round trip airfare Chicago to Miami 99 bucks 

and I thought well that's cool 

and so that's the advertisement right they said hey 99 bucks to get to from Miami to Chicago 

but then when I didn't realize is I still had to pay for the airfare to Chicago which by the time I added that in ..

there that's what we're doing here 

you're the travel company advertised and then I had to figure out what it cost to get there 

and so that's how we look at the path selection so after everything's put together whoever's got the lowest metric is the one that we're going to use 

now let me talk to you about this concept of lowest metric 

because I think this is and you know ..

I don't know how else to put this together other than just have a bunch of routers make sure that we have more than one path 


all right 

so there we go there's Miami 

just talked about it 

and and so as we're looking at our routing tables 

I realize that probably after I do metric lookups that this might be my shortest path for this might be my shortest path 


but every router is going to know about the past because they're all involved in that path 

and you know when you consider that I'm advertising a path to this router and this router is advertising it to I mean they're all learning about it 

it's not the best path 

but when I advertise my route 

my route to get advertised to this guy over here 

and then that guy's going to re-advertise it to me even though you know I already knew it 

that's just how they do 

they you comes in one interface goes out to all the other neighbors 

all right when I look at that metric and I see that maybe this metric was a thousand 

and the route being advertised me in this direction let's say comes in at 3,000 


well that's probably because I have you're basically saying look I'm going to go here 

then here back to you to get to this direction 

and so because that metric is so high that has an indication that it may be a loop to get back to what was the shortest path which is why we always look at the lowest number 

and that's what creates that loop free topology that the lowest number is believed to always be a loop free path 

if it has a higher number in my feet because you did go in a circle only to come back to where you started from and then make that trip sometimes my flights feel like that 

I don't know how it is that I get scheduled on these weird flights 

but sometimes I think they need to use eigrp who can be a flight schedule 

---- 1704

now when we continue to talk about the path selection 

there's a number of tables that we need to be aware of and so we're looking at this from the point of view of router c

when we advertise and if you care we use a multicast address of 2240010 that anybody who is speaking eigrp is going to listen to 

and it and that's how we discover our neighbors 

and one of the first tables we create as a neighbor table 

the reason for that is that and think about it this way like I assigned to say a number to my neighbor

that way if I learn about a route from or many routes from a neighbor 

and that neighbor goes down I can immediately say hey get rid of all of router A is routes becouse that that the router is not there anymore

---1746

anyway so that we have that we know the interface that we connected to them on with that multicast address 

that I just talked about the 2240010 

now from there each neighbor is always going to be directly connected they'll never be another route of between me and a neighbor on the same to be able to get from one of the other 


now what we're going to do is we're going to exchange routes between each other 

and that's where we're going to create the topology table 

not all of the routes somebody tells me about we're going to be the best route 

in fact what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at those 

I'm going to choose the best route out of all of my neighbors to any destination so every destination in this case the 1011 network too many ones again 


why it has the best metric 

what was that metric well rotary advertised it took a thousand to get there told it to me and I realized it took a thousand for me to get there so that was 2000 

router b said it takes the advertised $1,500 to get there 

I still had to add the thousand to get there so it's the second best one 


now the other thing I told you that there's a backup route 

a backup route is the thing called the feasible successor 

now in order to be a feasible successor 

this is an important aspect is that the administrative distance 

I shouldn't say the administrative distance the advertise distance has to be lower than my best distance that I have before 

total distance feasible distance ft 

if it's not at

then it means that I might have been going through a loop 

if the advertised distance is worse than my bestest since ever 

that mean I went through another router to come back here and then take that path to get to my destination 

yeah it could very well have meant that so that's how we get it feasible successor 

if that administrative distance is not better than the route even though it's in my topology table will never become a feasible successor 


and then well actually it could at some point if we find out after everything's been updated and everyone's talk to each other that maybe that is the only route 

then it could be but it's not automatic that's that fast convergence I was talking about 

and then of course we take all the successor routes 

and those are the ones that become the routes in the routing table 

and and so that's basically the topology table through that we got the successor maybe feasible successor best routes successor route goes into the routing table 

and that's what we use for all the packets that are received by the router to look to see if we're going to route them to those destinations 


--- 2033

eigrp has the K values

and I say that because when you looked at the original equation there was k1 equals k3 equals k5 and K2 equals K4 as part of these 

so you decided might doing bandwidth and delay 

and if I wanted to in my house is going to add reliability and load as a part of the equation 

and and the reason I said equally believable is not that the bandwidth and delay were equal to each other but these were each day value had a value of 0 or value of one on 

and so that was an important aspect as to whether or not we cared about bandwidth and delay 

join you all want to know that 

yeah probably not unless you might see it on a test somewhere when you do the command show IP protocols 


you we'll see an indication of what I mean K values 

so anyway this is k1 this is k3 and they both equal one and that's probably what I should have done in that little top part to say YK won't equals k3 out of that by default that's what they do 

whereas these k values basically are zeros 


they're off 

but you can turn them on 

it's not recommended it's really not needed 

but because of all of those criteria that we look at 

we can actually make the decision about what's the best route mathematically by using those values and putting them in to our table 

now at some point you might say well what's k5 can 

well we used to tell people optionally you could use MTU 

empty you is a different creature 

and I don't want to get into the what the MTU does unless we get into some advanced eigrp 


let's just say we're not going to utilize that for making the best route calculation 

but it did have a decision criteria it wasn't actually used in the creation of the metric 

but helping is kind of that final acquaintance about the whether or not we're going to use routes 


all right now here's an example of the equation that we use but it basically comes down to bandwidth and delay 

which by the way was the same as the predecessor igrrp 

but Igrp was a class full protocol it was a distance Vector on not this hybrid or this in advance disinfector like eigrp 

there's a fancy way of saying it's the distance factor that has a lot of link state capabilities 

and so we multiplied that by 256 so we can actually get a more granular feel of what the actual metric was 

and I know that sounds funny but it was actually some division done in this sorry in this calculation that they didn't quite show you but what it basically did is if I had a let's say my route to route 1 have a metric pair of 105.83 five and the other one had 105. 726 

we'd round them both up to look equal we'd say hey the metrics 106 

but now that we multiply those numbers by 256 and the essence removing that decimal point at least two spaces of not more over 

so we're getting a granular or better look at which is the best route instead of the rounding errors 

all right that's called history folks 

you might not be asked a lot of those questions anymore but just so you understand kind of where that came from and why it was added in there

these values you can find as far as bandwidth delay in the restroom when you do a show interface 

well so there's empty you there's the bandwidth on this 1.5 4 4 

here's the delay that we're seeing reliability is 100% $255 out of 255 transmit load is almost zero one out of 255 

and the receive load is almost zero 

well what do we say we used well at circle too many things bandwidth right and delay 

that we're looking at and then optionally we did say you could add in some of the other factors 

but that's what the information comes from so you can see that as the interface statistics change 

and there's a very good likelihood that some of the information about the best routes may also change 

the configuration for eigrp it starts off the same as with any routing protocol 


you're in global config you type router 

then the routing protocol in this case eigrp 

and then we include the autonomous system that is not a process ID but we saw with OSPF 

that is the autonomous system that either you make up about an air hoping you never talk to the internet world with a routing protocol 

or it's one that was assigned to you 

and just like IP addresses that are global or assigned to you 

from there you then list the network for each interface that you want to have two things happen 

when you want the network that this interface is connected to the advertised in eigrp 

and you want to have the chance to form a neighbor over that interface 

so we put in this interface and really if this is a cloud you probably don't want a neighbor 

so we still have the passive option but we do want to advertise that network into the rest of their cloud 

and then we have this interface of the one that one that's also going to be advertised and hopefully creating a neighbor relationship with this headquarters router 

and it looks like we will because we're advertising the same network but oh what on earth did they do here 

they added a wild card mask 

yep that can still be used that would just mean like it does with OSP yeah if there were two or more interfaces or one or more interface 


that match the combination of ip and wild card mask that it would include all of those interfaces for being advertised and trying to form neighbors 

so you can do that as well 

here grp is not as picky about its neighbors like ospf 

you know we talked about whole times maybe and things like that and you know what the timers don't have to agree like they do notice yet but what does is the autonomous system 

if these two routers are going to be neighbors they have to be within the same autonomous system that you've created otherwise you can basically think of each other as being a foreigners of being managed by separate independent companies and they won't become neighbors 

the same with authentication if you put authentication in here they got to have the same authentication information passwords and such to be able to be neighbors 

other than they're pretty straightforward so we can verify with those neighbors are other way this first value is just an internal index number for that app for that particular neighbor 

I have no other purpose other than to keep one neighbor separate from another the address of the neighbor the interface that I'm connecting to 


which of my interfaces I'm leaving to get there 

how long I'm going to leave there alive until I hear from them again 

by the way they send their hellos back and forth to each other every 5 seconds so we wouldn't expect to ever see this never get to below 10 or over 15 just because we should see those updates all the time 

how long I've been a neighbor that's good for trouble shooting that number is low and every other neighbor's been there for hours or days or weeks it makes me wonder what happened to that neighbor for just a little bit 

I'm not going to get too much into the smooth round trip timer options or some of the other things just so that we again those in the advanced topics but what we're looking for is that we do have a neighbor that they are seen by us and that they're in the neighbor table 

so we can begin being able to not only send  hello package to keep the neighbor alive but to also begin to exchange routes 


all right we did the same command only this time for the headquarters 

and again the goal is to see the neighbor 

that it's on the headquarters 000 interface 

oh we've been neighbors for a little bit so must have been some time between when they Randy's commands 

and of course that we're seeing the hellos going back and forth 

so that's all good right that we have verified the neighbors and it was just after you did the router eigrp autonomous system 100 and basically hit enter 

then they began trying to discover each other and become neighbors 

another one you can run is the eigrp interfaces 

those are the interfaces because of the network command 

that are not only advertising their networks but also trying to form peer relationships 

remember we were advertising this interface going out to this cloud whatever it was on that gig interface 00 

well look no peers 


I didn't expect to see any 

so that's pretty much what I had hoped it seens

and and then of course the cereal 0001 I do have up here so I am seeing my neighbors 

and so now I'm seeing which interfaces are you actively a part of the exchange of routes and are actively trying to create neighbors with somebody to exchange routes 

when you look at the routes in a routing table 

all of the D's are the eigrp's now this is what I see from if I look at my branch router 

that it knows how to get to the 17216 network 


the first number is the administrative distance 

the second number is the metric 

this is the one that had the best cost the best metric 

my next stop is 1921681.2 which looks right 

I've known about this route for over an hour and my outbound interface is 0000 

so that looks appropriate as far as what I would expect to see on my routing table 

remember that the topology table is all knowledge that I've learned 

well we were just looking at the route to the 17216 network 

and here we see that we have learned it 

it has one successor that means one best route 

they could have had two if they had the same cost 

---3105


the feasible distance that it takes for me to get there that's why I full distance says 

this distance plus whatever that router needed to get there is this big number 156 6160 

and it's going out again to that next top neighbor which was the right address 

now this is my feasible distance that I just talked about 

this is what was advertised 

that was what was advertised to me by HQ router 

and so again I had to take my distance to get to the HQ to add it to what HQ me about 

and and then that's the only route really of interest because that was the only route 

even though all of the direct connected inter 

aces right there directly connected interfaces are in my apology channel as they should be right there directly connected so 

I didn't have any of those other distances too at least to help you describe 






what is it you're reading 
---3150
I've already talked about equal cost multipath 

load balancing it for both routes in this case two routes the same destination the same metric we're going to round Rob meaning we'll take turns with all of the packets that I'm sending per flow is an important aspect 

unequal is that analogy of me about the kids taking out the the groceries for me but here's the thing that you have to remember 


now in order for this route here to be used in this unequal cost multipath or load balancing it has to first have been able to qualify as a feasible successor 

it means it's advertised distance has to be better than the original metric I had to begin with it that  doesn't happen there's no unequal cost though balancing then 

I put in a multiplier is five 

what I'm saying is that I will balance between any route between a metric of 25

through 5 times 25 or 125 well if that falls in the range and it counts 

and I would use it remember first have to qualify as a feasible successor

so we took a look at the basic implementation of EIGRP again a classless advantance Vector protocol mining it's the distance factor with some of greatest features of link states 

we talked about the composite metric 

formula and within delay by default  

I'm using other features if you wanted to to look for the best route 

that it's configured on the router to the router EIGRP command that

again has to have autonomous system that all  of them all the routers in your network have to exchange routes and that we turnned on the interface  to advertise and it for neighbors of the network command 

three tables the neighbor table who it is we heard with the hellos 

it's topology table the list of all known routes 

and out of those who found the best routes called the successors and that went into the routing table
unequals as I have to routes that are giving me the same destination 

one has a metric of 25 which is great that has got a metric of 100 which is not as good as 25 

in order to do unequal low-cost balancing you first have to turn that feature on 

and then after you turn it on you have to give me a multiplier what you would consider be too high be of another route that I can equal
