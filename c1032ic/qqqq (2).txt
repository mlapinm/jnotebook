aspect unequal is that analogy of me about the kids taking out the the groceries for me but here's the thing that you have to remember unequals as I have to routes that are giving me the same destination one has a metric of 25 which is great that has got a metric of 100 which is not as good as 25 in order to do unequal low-cost balancing you first have to turn that feature on and then after you turn it on you have to give me a multiplier what you would consider be too high be of another route that I can equal now in order for this route here to be funny ing it has to first have been able to qualify as a feasible successor it means it's advertised distance has to be better than the original metric I had that doesn't happen there's no unequal cost though balancing then I put in a multiplier is five what I'm saying is that I will balance between through * 25 or 125 well if that falls in the range and it counts and I would use it remember first have to qualify as a feasible so we took a look at the basic implementation of EIG r please list enter protocol with some of the Great features formula and within delay by I'm using other features if you wanted to to look for the best route that it's configured on the router to the router EIG r again has evidence system that all orders Europe and that we turned on the interface to advertise and it for neighbors of the network command three tables the neighbor table who it is we heard with the pillows it's apology table the list of all known routes and out of those who found the best routes called the successors and that went into the routing table
