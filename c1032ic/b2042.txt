Let's let's take a look at how to implement ospf in a multi-area environment 

now the first time we saw ospf was a single area 

and that's actually getting more and more popular because of those type 10 that talks about the traffic in here and database 

but in the 1990s our routers just didn't have the capability of having large routing tables or being able to use the processes that can handle all those spfs 

so we went to the multi-area design to just try to reduce the amount of lsa it flooded if itâ€™s topology changes or to reduce the routing table or to do both 

now in that case that's where the multi-area came in 

I remember the multi area if you look at it is best suited by design for having very well structured way of handing out the IP addresses to the different neighbors or the different routers that you have 

try to find a way to be able to send out summaries into the core hundreds of routes being flooded in the core 
1
lsa floating is usually confined within an area 

with the exceptions is saids like type 3 which is summary routers in the area 0

the goal of the multi-area was really to make the router more efficient 

but in today's world you can probably get away with a single area is today's routers have enough memory to be to handle the lsa's or the size of the routing tables that you would see 

probably the hardest part of configuring ospf is actually creating the design of where you want the areas to be 

remember that a part of the design should take into account the IP addressing 

that's one of the things that I think is crucial into being very efficient 

but even if you don't you still have to understand where the area boundaries are going to be 

where is area 0 and what is going to define the other area that you want to create 

that means you want to look and make sure you understand the topology of your network 

you also have to have routers that can connect the areas to the backbone remember those are called the area for the routers 
206
Now you may have multiple avrs so there's more than one of area 

that probably would recommend that also 

if you're going to do route redistribution 

you're going to have to figure out where the asbr's as autonomist system

are going to be located at the beginning once you create that diagram implementation plan and then look at how to configure ospf 

but that's what we're going to focus on here is how did the configuration




when it comes to configuring ospf it's actually quite easy like this is the hardest part is planning 

like where do you want the avrs in this case route or two looks like it's going to be an APR it's going to be the router that's in between areas zero the backbone and area one 

never going to focus first on the router one it looks like it only has one interface that is going to be a part of this network 

and that's that gigabit 00 interface 

so it's actually quite easy to set up 

the first thing you have to do is well is going into 
310
a global configuration and type in the command router OSPF 

so we know that you're running ospf 

and then we create what's called a process ID 

now this is not an autonomous system it is not a number that all the routers have to agree on 

it internal to the router to let us know how many times you want to run ospi 

in other words if you want to run ospf 10 different times that you would just create a different process ID for each of the osps 

usually we're only going to see one 

so we're going to call it ospf 1 

the number is just completely up to you 

from there we identify which interfaces are going to be advertising the their routes into ospf as well as which interfaces are going to form neighbors in ospf 

we do that with the network command 

the network command is followed here so wild card mask 
4

So if you could imagine it maybe I had a different interface it might be 10.64.1.0 and maybe another interface over here that's 10.64.2.0 make them look like difference subnets

what they are 

This wild card mask

If we had made a change this 0 to a 255 with the basically be saying look 

I remember in a wild card master 255 me in these have to be wild cards you need any number we don't care 

the zeros mean it must be an exact match 

if I rewrote it down here 

it was kind of look like this 

How been the inverse of what I'm a subnet mask might look like 

so the wild card message saying hey the tens must match the 64 must match 

and we don't care if the last two octets are that's 255 

that command would actually have turned on all three interfaces for ospf because all three of them mach the first 16 bits the 10.64 
5
so that's what it does or you could be very specific 

if you wanted to say you know just one interface in particular 

it could have just typed it in this way with the wild card with all zeros 

this is the most exact thing that is just the way we have to tell the router which area that interface 

plus we tell the router which area interface is in 

that's very important when we're forming neighbors cuz remember to be a neighbor of them have to be in the same area

now that we've got that set up 

the next part of what you see is the configuration of the interface 

I can will soon that interface configure so here you can see that on the one gigabit 00 interface 

we gave it his address we gave it a subnet mask and here we are manually setting the cost 

so I can't remember the reference bandwidth 

 the reference bandwidth have the cost of 1 gigabit

So here we're saying the cost is 10 
6
we're doing that probably because we want to help influence the past in which traffic is going to go 

at least here in this little diagram with just three routers that cost me as probably not all that important because it's still going to be one choice 

but it's your way of one of your ways to be able to overcome a reference bandwidth 

now we're looking at router number two 

router number two is the AVR 

and so it's going to have a little bit different configuration it's got two interfaces that are going to be involved in those ospf 

the first command we saw here 00 to be again in the same subnet as its neighbor

More importantly is the router ospf 

I remember this is a process ID it does not have to society it does not have to match the same process ID as router 1 

we don't it's internal as I said before you could have made this hours if you wanted to with your or just fine 

again the network command was designed to be able to say specifically which interfaces are going to be advertised as well as which interfaces that we want to form neighbors

The first interface we put in area 0 as appropriate cuz that has to match the area 0. Router for drop zero 

so that would help these two become neighbors 

the second one is an area one 

now because we can figure two interfaces in different areas other tool automatically know that it's an AVR that's not a configuration is just that you have to specifically say OSPF

two interfaces That are in two different areas makes it an area for the router 

to verify that you have the connections working and remember the router two of the AVR 

we use a command like show IP ospf neighbor 
8
IP for IP version 4 

Now here in that neighbor relationship what we're seeing is that we see two different neighbors 

we see that we are fully exchanged in routes 

that's something that's very important that you see full 

you might sometimes see a router destanate two-way state 

if you remember my discussion about the designated router part of this setup for everybody's on the same ethernet segment 

so they call the router 2 and it called designated router 

router 2 has to be fully exchange for the designated router 

those routers that are not designated routers are still neighbors 

but they would be listed in the two way meaning that they see each other 

they involves both directions to a exchange pillows but they don't exchange routes 

we only exchange routes with the DRS 

and that's on ethernet if this was an interface that was a different type like a serial letter face you want to see full to know that everything's working
9
From there of course we see the address of of the neighbor as well as you were seeing the routers ID 

and which interface we're using to connect to them 

so here we see two neighbors off of 2 interfaces and they're in the full state which is a good thing to see 

now if you want to specifically look at the interfaces and how they're configure the show IP ospf interface does that for you 

now in this particular case of course the interface we hope is often 
up and it tells us the area of the interface is in 

what process it is running in our ospf 

and I was cath again you could have multiple ospf processes that would be very rare in the router that's sort of full Customers connected to 

it that have to have their own routing tables otherwise for the enterprise is usually just one process 

and so this is my way to verifying that I have two interfaces one in each area 

and again that makes me verify that this router is also the area one of the router 

one the best commands that said it before is show IP protocols 

should I be protocols I will tell you exactly how you can figure each routing protocol whether it's OSPF or eigrp 

in this case we're verifying that it's ospf process number one 

it's showing me which networks I am advertising and those of course are linked to the interfaces but in figure

It also telling me about sources of routing information which are coming from my neighbors so that in this case is showing me that I have two neighbors and those neighbors that shows me the IP addresses and how often I'm getting or lose the last update that I've seen

those are very important again for the configuration or the verify the configuration of ospf 

do you remember ospf has or can have multiple areas 

area 0 is the backbone and the other areas in this case that are attached 

when we look at specifically ospf route 

we need me to the show IP route we had ospf so we only see the ospf routes 
11
the indication that it's always OSPF is the first letter of the o which here shows you that it's ospf 

and then it will tell me other little things like intererea 

which is this IA up here means that it might be a route 

and this is router one that we're talking about right router one was over here or not in areas zero 

it was connected to router 2 

but what it means is that a route was learned but Type 3 was sent from area 1 area 0 and then it was sent to this router 

from router two router one 

so it's a route that's in a different area 

that we see that specifically 

when we take a look at the routing information 

now remember the next number here is the administrative distance which by default for ospf is 110

and the cost for the metric for that route as well as and of course who's the next top and what interface would I use to leave that router to get there 
12

so we look that so how to configure multiple areas with ospf on our routers whether they're an internal router or there are a core router or the area of order rout er 

we talked about the process ID how you use network command 

how you identify which interfaces which in which area 


And then we looked at waste and verify that configuration is working either through the show IP ospf neighbor or maybe to the show IP route for ospf routes 

one of the things we didn't look at was the show IP ospf database

how we show us all the different type ones type 2 3 for being said 

but our goal was to be able to verify does we have correctly and we have all routes how we were expecting
