hey everyone and welcome to my 2048
game walkthrough

in this walkthrough i'm going to show
you how to make the popular game
2048 in pure javascript
html and css no fancy frameworks
required

i am also going to show you how i use ai
in order to
train my code editor and how i code

what no for real like legitimate deep
learning

but first they're on the same page let's
remind ourselves of the rules
of 2048

2048 is a single player sliding block
puzzle game 

the game was designed by 19
year old web developer
gabrielle cerulli 

the game's objective
is to slide tiles on the grid in order
to make up the number
2048 

we start off with two numbers
already generated on our screen
and keep sliding to generate new ones as
we combine totals

we lose if we fill up the entire grid
with numbers
and win when we get the number 2048

pretty simple the 19 year old web
developer created this game in a single
weekend just to see if he could create a
game from scratch

he was surprised when he received over 4
million visitors
in one week the game is free to play

asarouli said he's uncomfortable taking
money from something 

he didn't invent
himself
oh right so those are the rules of 204.8

let's get to coding it with my newly
made ai friend

right so as always we are going to make
sure that the script tag and link tag
are hooked up correctly

meaning that the relative paths are
correct for each one
i have chosen to put my script tag here

many of you
may prefer to put your script tag at the
bottom of your file if you do so make
sure that it's after all your code

so that the javascript is run after the
html
has loaded 

okay now the first thing i'm
going to do is put a div
with a class name of grid right here

this is where we're going to create our
entire grid game 

so let's treat it with
some respect
and sign it up so we can see it in our
browser

flip over to your css file and grab the
div with the class name of grid
but using a dot this means class name so
dot grid

now i'm gonna make my grid 400 pixels by
400 pixels big

you can choose whatever size you would
like just make sure it fits
a grid of four by four squares

let's also give it a background color 

so
we can see what we are working with

i am also going to use display flex and
flex
wrap to make sure anything i put into
this grid in the future

namely the divs that will be our squares

don't stack over each other
like the default setting of a div 

i want
them to appear next to each other so
in line and wrap over each other like a
snake

once we have done this let's save the
file

now let's open our index html path and
our browser so we can see what we have
done so far
so here 

we go and our browser should pop
up
a blue grid 

perfect
we can also inspect the page to get our
console up

by left-clicking on our browser and
selecting inspect

let's keep that up here so we can see
what's happening in our console log
later down the line

this is great for debugging and i'll
show you how to use the console log
later 

okay now let's get to writing some
javascript

now as we need all our html before
writing any javascript or running any
javascript 

i need to add a document
event listener
and pass through dom content loaded like
this

all our javascript code will now be
written in the event listener from now
on

now the first thing we need to do is
pick out our grid 

we just made
so our javascript can speak to it 

we
do so by deciding that we are going to
store it 

as let's store it as
const grid display now using document
query selector 

i'm going to pick out the
div
with a class name of grid like this
making

sure not to get the dot as we need to
tell it 

we are looking for the class
of grid 

now you may be noticing
something cool happening here

my vs code editor suggesting code
completion

see see this little cool percentage of
accuracy right here

i am actually using artificial
intelligence for my code editor to
suggest what
i am trying to write 

so i can write code
quicker and more accurately

i've literally only just discovered this
and i'm in love

it's actually a package called tab 9
and it gets smarter than what we code
along in a project

you will see it gets better and smarter
the more we code

i'm just going to tap tab 9 here to show
you which version
i am using now 

because i've already
taught it a little bit about how i like
to code 

i'm going to see if it's taught
itself how to help me

i'm going to pick out another element
from my html file
which i have not written yet 

but i'm
going to need 

let's call it
score display now 

i want to pick up the
element using document query selector

but it looks like timeline 

already does
that and has suggested it here for me

all i need to do is press tab for it to
auto complete

pretty cool right okay 

let's actually
just
score for now

if you want to check out this cool ai
package simply 

add it to your packages
here is what it looks like 

okay let's
carry on
before i start adding any squares 

who
are great in our javascript

let's tell our code what we want these
future squares to look like
flip over to your css file 

and add the
following
let's grab the div with the class name
of grid again
and by typing div like this 

we are
saying that any div
and only any div inside this div with
the class name of grid
will be styled 

this way we want
each div or future square to have a
width of 100 pixels
and a height of 100 pixels 

and let's
give it a background color for now again
just so we can see what we are doing

let's make it yellow so background color
yellow click save and flip back to your
javascript file

uh we forgot to address one thing didn't
we we need to add the element
with the something of score to it

whether it's a class or id we don't
know we haven't decided yet hence no dot
or hash

so back to our html file we go
right above the grid 

let's put our score
so i'm actually going to put our score
in its own box or container

so i'm going to make a div with a class
of let's call it score container

and in it i'm going to put a div for
these score titles 

so i can
style it up later and put in some inner
html of score 

so it shows up in our
browser

i am also going to add a div with the id
of score here

and hard code as zero for now

okay this looks good to me i'm happy
with that 

let's flip back to our
javascript file

now you will notice i decided on using
an id of score

this means we need to change this piece
of code 

let's tell our javascript we are
picking up an id
by putting a hash here okay
cool 

we can actually also do something
else we want 

we can use the method of
get element by id

if we do this we do not need the hash
anymore as our javascript knows what we
are looking for 

we're looking for an id
so we can get rid of this hash here

so there we have it two options for us
to work with

let's just quickly save all of this and
go to our browser to see if everything
is working 

before we go
on and great 

i can see the word
score and the zero 

that we hard coded

above our grid let's carry on

i'm going to add one more thing to our
html file and that is a place for us to
tell the user
if we have won or lost here 

i'm going to
write a div
with the id of results

so div id and the string result

you know what to do now 

let's flip over
to our javascript file and pick this out
to work with

so what should 

we call it 

let's call it
result display
just for consistency so const result
display equals
document 

and look at our ai go again
fourth one down 

get element by a deep
result amazing so slick 

i love it

okay let's carry on now we are at the
part where we will be creating squares
to go in our grid

let's do this by writing a function

let's choose to call this function

create board now
using a for loop 

i'm going to loop over
this function
until we have created the correct amount
of squares to go on our grid

so four by four squares is what we need

let's use the constant
width so width multiplied by width and
set the constant of width

here as for so we are saying here that
as long as i
is smaller than 16 

we want to keep
looping
so using the increment operator again

so all of this is obviously for loop
syntax if you don't know
which is a plus plus 

that's the
increment operator plus plus 

we
increment by one each time
so this means as long as i is smaller
than 16

we want a following block of code to be
executed

we want to create a square
and what is this square 

let's use
document and an input method called
create
element and pass through div to create a
div

now this creates a div which as far as
our javascript is aware
is now known to us as a square we want
to give

this square an inner html of zero

we do so by grabbing the square adding
the inner html method to it

and make it equal zero finally for every
square we create with an inner html of
zero

we want to put it in our grid 

we do this
by grabbing the grid constant so grid
display
using an inbuilt method of append child
and passing through the square into it
like this 

and
lastly we also want to collect these
squares in their own array so we can
work with it

let's call this new array squares
so let's squares equal an empty array
above

okay now that we have an empty squares
array 

we use the inbuilt method
push to push each newly created square
with an inner html of zero into this
array got it 

okay i think we are done

let's go ahead and invoke this function
to see if it has worked 

but i'm feeling
pretty confident
so create board and let's save file

let's flip over to our browser and hit
refresh

and great we can see
we have now created 16 yellow squares
with an inner html of zero

amazing this is looking so good so far

let's maybe just make these zeros a bit
bigger so we can see
them 

so let's go back to our project and
back to our css file

okay now in this file let's go back to
styling our divs in the grid

how big do we want to make the font
using font size 

let's say 16 for now 

i
don't know if that's big enough

while we're here i'm also going to
center the font for this i will use text
align and center

let's make it bold 

why not i like bots
so font weight bold

okay that should work not sure about the
font size as i said but hey 

we will work
it out

let's go back to our browser
hit refresh ah the numbers are bold and
centered but way too small

okay let's go back to our css file 

let's
go ahead and make the font size 60
pixels 

okay so 60 pixels
hit save now go back to our browser
hit refresh 

and great that's
much better

okay now we are happy with that 

let's
move on

now the first thing we want to do to
make our game of 2048 is add a number
or more precisely 

the number two to a
random position on our board

in fact we actually need to add two
numbers randomly when we start the game
but then one night each time we swipe
the board 

but let's just worry about
adding one number

for now and go from there 

okay
let's do this right here so generate a
number
randomly 

i'm going to need a function
for this 

let's choose to call this
function generate

okay so the first thing i'm going to do
is pick a random position on our grid
for our numbers to go into

so let's call this random number

now using a javascript method called
math random 

i'm going to multiply
this by the squares array length to give
me a random number based on the amount
of items 

i have in my squares array
i will then wrap it in another
javascript method called my floor

i'm doing this as i want to round down

whatever we get back to the newest
integer

just to make sure this number is not
over the length if it's not a full
number

i'm just going to add a let here 

so our
variable
is now declared 

now that we have our
random number
or in other words our random square on
our grid 

we need to check that 

we can
place our 2 there

how are we going to choose to do this

well i'm simply going to check if the
random square

we are in has an inner html of zero

if it does we are good to go otherwise

we need to generate again
so if the squares array index of
whatever our random number is
in our html equals zero note 

we're using
two equal signs here as we don't only
eat deeply equal zero 

we want it to be
true whether
zero here is a number or a string so if
it equals zero and the statement is true

we want to give the same square an inner
html of two

let's just go over this again 

okay so if
my random number generated to be
turned out to be five 

let's say this
means that if the fifth index
item in my squares array had an inner
html of zero

we want to give it an inner html of two

got it if this statement is false
however we want to run through this
function

again we do this by writing else and
passing through the generate function
again

okay let's hook this up to see if this
worked

where do we need to invoke this function
well

we need to generate a number when we
create the board right 

so let's put it
right here
at the bottom of the create board
function

now let's save this file 

now let's flip
over to our browser hit refresh
and great 

you will see a two pop
up 

let's hit refresh again and again
and create a two will pop up in random
position

each time now we did say we wanted two
twos to pop up 

so let's fix this now

let's head over to our javascript file

now this
is a simple fix as we want two numbers
to generate all we need to do is invoke
this
function again 

let's go ahead and add
another generate right here

okay great let's see if that has worked

and fantastic i now get two twos popping
up randomly

i also don't have to worry about them
overlapping 

as we know the generate
function will only place a 2
in each square if there's a 0 there
first otherwise

it will re-run itself 

let's carry on
now that we have our numbers popping up

let's get to writing 

what will happen
when we want all of our numbers to swipe
right

just like in the game so function
move right 

let's call it using a for
loop i want to loop over the entirety of
our grid

again so as long as i is smaller than
width multiply by width
or let's just i mean we could just write
16 here right it's the same thing 

why
not

we need the following block of code to
execute

now as we want to get our grid and
essentially shovel the numbers in each
row to the right

the first thing we should do is define
what our row is

we are going to do this using modulus so
if i modulus 4 deeply equals zero

we are telling our javascript to execute
the following

now by writing this statement 

we are
saying that we want our javascript to
only execute this code
if the square with index 0 4 8 and 12

so essentially the left hand side of our
grid 

these four squares are the start of
each of our four rows

now if any are in these
four squares we want to get the inner
html of these
three squares to the right of it 

okay so
including itself
i'm gonna do so like this

let total one equal my squares array and
the
index we just passed through so if it's
a four

we are getting the square with index 4
in the html
and storing it as total 1. 

we also need
to do that for the
next square to it right and store it

so let total 2 equal
square with index i plus one
in html and store that 

ah look at that
timeline already knew what we wanted to
write it's mental
pretty cool 

let's see if it does it for
the total three and total four

so let total three in total four needs
to store
the index of i plus two to our squares
array in their html

no way this ai is crazy 

good okay total
four and whoa
it totally knew to pass through an i
plus 3 into our squares array
creepy 

but amazing let's carry on

now that we have our four values stored

let's
make a new array that will be our row

let's call this row
now because at the moment these values
are strings we need to turn them into
numbers so we can work with them

we need to use a javascript method
called passint to do this

and pass through each value 

oh wow
timeline beat us to it 

i mean it's
already suggesting the whole array

let's just add total four as it seems to
miss that one out

and great we now have our row as an
array

i'm just going to collapse this so we
can see easier

i'm going to console.log what we've done
so far just so we can check
everything is working 

as it should so
console.log and pass through row

now let's invert this function 

here we
should get row

we should get four row arrays pop up in
our console log on the browser

let's see if that has worked so save

let's refresh our browser and there we
have it
four rows that reflect the inner html of
what we see on our browser

perfect let's carry on now i'm just
going to show you what would happen if
we didn't use pass int

i'm going to comment this out and
rewrite the row just with the
values 

we would get an array of strings
which is fine for now but would cause
problems down the line when we start
adding numbers together as strings will
not act the same way 

when
adding them together this is why we need
to use pass in to change them from
strings to numbers

so let's save this file and hit refresh
in our browser

and there we have it four arrays of
strings

let's go back to our javascript and undo
this 

so we can carry on
lovely now these next four lines of code
someone actually showed me once before
from the coding train

and i thought they were just the neatest
pieces of code ever so i'm going to
share them with you 

today also
if you haven't had coding train or code
train sorry code train it's a pretty
cool youtube channel so please do check
it out

love their instructor he has so much
enthusiasm for what he teaches and it's
really great to see

so what we are now going to do to move
the numbers along

all the way to the right hand side of

our display grid is we're going to use a
method called
filter first to filter out all the
numbers from our rows

as it's going to produce a new row 

we
need to save this as something

let's call it filtered row now 

let's
grab the rotary and attach the method
filter like this

and pass through the following 

this is
how we're going to filter out any
element in our row array 

that has a
number
and store it as a new array 

let's
console like this to see if it has
worked

so console.log filtered row

let's save this head over to our browser
and hit refresh 

and great each time we
console
our row 

we also console log our filtered
row under it
now because only two rows have a number
in them 

this is what we are seeing

so we're two there in the third row and
a two
there in the fourth row 

perfect let's
carry on
that's great 

we have our filtered
numbers 

but now we need to fill all the
elements that don't have a number
with a zero again 

how do we do this
especially when we don't know how many
each ray will have 

let's tackle this

first let's make a new variable for this
called
missing as we know each row has four
elements 

we can hard code for here
and minus however many elements we have
on our filtered row

how do we tell our javascript 

we want
this number 

we simply get our filter
array and find out how many elements in
it by using the method
length 

now the only thing left to do is
minus it from four

now that we know how many elements are
left to fill 

let's make a new array
called zeros

this is where we create an array of
zeros based on
the amount of elements 

we are missing
using the method of array 

we pass
through the number assigned to the
variable missing
to create an array with the exact amount
of elements based on this number

we then use the method of fill to fill
each element with the number of zero
like this again 

let's console.log this
to see what is happening

so console.log zeros save the file

go to the browser and hit refresh
and great just after the array filtered
row

you will see a new array filled with
zeros

amazing the last thing we need to do now
is attach the zeros array to the
filtered array in the right order 

let's
call it new row

now let's grab the zeros array and using
the method of concat

let's join up these zeros away to the
filtered array
by passing the filtered row rate into
the method

that was a mouthful 

we have to do it in
this order to make sure the filtered row
is after the zeros as we want them to
visually appear on the right
side 

let's console up this two for good
measure

save the file go to the browser
and hit refresh 

and
great we now have four new arrays of how
our grid

should look like when we swipe all the
numbers to the right

fantastic
now just as we got the inner html of our
red before

we need to now assign these new numbers
to our rows

the logic of this will be very similar
to what we did before

so let's grab the square of whatever
index we are working with at the moment

remember it will be index zero four
eight or twelve

now we need to get its inner html and
assign its new value
in this case 

it will be the first
element of our newly created row

so new row password is zero to make sure

we get the first element

we do the same for the next square so
square i plus
one 

and assign it the value of the
second element in our new
row array by passing through the index
one

and the same for the next square so i
plus two grab its inner html

and assign it a new value which is the
third element in the newly created row

so we grab the new row array and pass
through the index two

and just one more to go square i plus
three and html equal new row and
password three

okay so instead of seeing numbers in the
console 

we should see them always
congregating to the right hand side of
our grid when we refresh

so let's refresh and see and
great the numbers are always pushed up
to the right
side 

we've done it this is great now

all we have to do is the same for the
left
swipe up swipe down swipe and start
combining our numbers together

let's focus on the move left function

first
as the move function is so so similar to
the move right function

i'm actually going to go ahead and copy
the entire move right function to make
my move left function

and it's a bit naughty 

but whatever and
make a few small but important changes

so once that is done 

i'm going to change
the pseudo code here

change the function name here and then

i'm going to delete this line of code
here

and change the order of how i concat the
filtered rows and zeros

this is because now i want everything to
be a bunch up on the left hand side

so let neuro equal filtered row concat
zeros 

there that's it let's also change
the names function here
and leave it invoked and invoke the move
right function by deleting it

okay let's save and see if that has
worked

so now we should see all the numbers
crunch up to the left hand side 

okay so
let's see if that's worked and
perfect everything is working as it
should

let's move on okay while we are here 

i'm
just going to clean this up a bit so get
rid of all these console logs

delete delete
delete

okay now uninvoke this move left
function

and great it is now time to write our
combine
function 

this means that the more
numbers we add we can start combining
numbers if two numbers 

that are the same
are next to each other in the swipe
direction

so function combine row 

let's call it
again with a loop 

we're going to loop
over not the whole array
but up to 15 times 

this is because we
don't want to be checking
the square to the right of the very last
because it doesn't exist

right so which means we need to account
for 

this because everything will break
if we don't

so we don't need to be checking for the
16th squares
right square 

okay you'll see what i mean

when we start coding

so if this square and our squares array

we are looping over

inner html deeply equals the square next
to it
specifically one down in our squares
array

we need to execute a block of code if
this statement is true it means two
numbers next to each other in a row
are the same 

so if they are true we need
to combine them

let's make this new combined total a
variable called combine total

so the inner html of the square plus the
inner html of the next square down
is a combined total remember 

let's use
the strings we need to wrap them around
the past
int to make them numbers 

this will mean
that if the inner html of our square is
two
and the next one down is two our
combined total will now be four

we then need to assign our square this
new combined total

so let's grab it go into our squares
array pass through the number 

we are
looping over
get into its inner html and assign
a due total 

we
also now need to give the next square
down a total of zero

let's do that in the same way so
grabbing the square 

we are looping over
but assign a plus one to it as we want
the next one down
and giving it inner html a total of zero

great that should work
now to see if these numbers are
combining 

let's start attaching
functions to key codes this means that
when we press the
up down left or right button on our
keyboard we should start invoking
functions

for this let's write a function called
control and pass through e
for revenge

now if the key code we press is deeply
equal to 39
we want to make sure the squares appear
to slide right

and combine to their new totals y39

well that's just the code of the
particular key on your keyboard

okay so let's write this q write
function 

first
function keywrite would involve us
invoking the move right function 

we
wrote
followed by combining the row so the
combining row function needs to go here

then followed by another move write
function again
because you know in the combined row
function 

they'll be like spread out

again we need to make sure they're all
to the right so move right function
again 

and finally we need to generate a
new
random number amazing

let's put this keywrite function on our
control function

now we need to add a document event
listen to our page to listen out for any
time we press a key 

and
anytime we do press a key we want to
invoke the control function

this stream key up is one of many events

we can pass through into our event
listener 

so i didn't make it up like
it's an actual thing

okay great let's save this file and head
over to our browser to check

and let's press the right arrow key on
our keyboard

and great you will see the numbers 

if
you're going to move right
and combine over each other as well as
generate a new two
in a blank space or blank zero space

amazing now we know that has worked

let's write and hook up the key left
function

so back in the control function if the
key code deeply equals the 37

we want to invoke our future key left
function

now for those of you interested there's
actually a pretty cool website called
kiko.info that will give you

all the keycards you need for a project

it's built by westboss and it's updated
quite often

so do make sure to check it out you can
link up pretty much any key you want
which is pretty cool

okay now back to our project so key left

now let's get to writing the key left
function
so function key left is made up of the
move

left function combine row function
move left function and generate function
in that order

let's save the file and once again check
it out in our browser 

when we are done
and great by pressing the left key we
are now getting all the numbers to
scrunch up to the left hand side and
combine

only the key up and key down functions
to go

now as you guessed it our move down and
up functions are going to be pretty
similar to the others 

but we need to
loop over our squares array a little bit
differently 

as we will now want to check
four columns 

so let's start with the
swipe
down or move down function first
so move down function 

let's go as we are
going to be looping over
array as if we were checking columns 

we
only need to loop over the first
four elements in our squares array 

each
time we loop over the square 

we will
then check the squares
directly below 

it so this is one below

then two below than three below

this will be how we check for a whole
column

for example if we are in the second
square with an index of
one in our squares array 

we would then
check the square
with a one index plus a width
so square of index five then square of
index
nine 

and then square index 13. 

we would
need to get each one of their inner
htmls

to make an array called column
just like we did with our res array

let's do the same for columns

so let total 1 equals squares array
plus 3 and i for the index 

we are
looping over and get it in
html 

do the same for total two
but this time checking i plus width and
the same a total of three

so let's go to three equals squares and
pass through i plus two widths
and grab that squares in html and
finally total four

so go into the squares array look for
this square with index i
plus width multiply by three this time

okay great i'm just going to put this in
parenthesis to
neaten it up a little bit

okay now let columns so we make a new
array so open square brackets and pass
through the four values in here

turning them from strings to numbers
very similar right very similar to how
we were working before

just now we are making columns again

let filtered column then grab column
array
and using the method filter 

we filter
out the numbers
once again let me sing equal four
minus the filtered column length
and let zeros equal the method of arrays

so we are making a new array that is the
length of the missing elements

and we fill the elements with zero

now let new column equal the zeros and
we join the zeros array to the filter
column array
in that order as we want 

the numbers to
appear at the bottom of the column

and we add the values of the new column
to our squares in
htmls so squares i
n html equals the new columns first
element value

and squares i plus width in the html
equals the new column's second element
value

and so on until we get our column of
squares showing the new numbers

once again let's put them in parentheses
and neaten it all up a bit
now just like 

we did to create the move
left function 

let's copy and paste the
move down function to create
the move up function showing a few small

but important things while we do so
so change the pseudo code here 

change
the function name for move down to move
up 

let's delete this line of code here

so we can concat the two arrays in
reverse order
so let new column equal filter column
concat zeros

okay great this looks good now one last
thing to copy and paste

and that is the combine row function we
need to adapt this to combine columns
so once again 

let's paste this here
change combine row to combine column now

we only need to move over this to the
12th element of our squares array 

why is
this
this because we're going to be checking
the square directly below the square 

we
are looping over

and we can't do that as soon as we hit
the 13 square as there is no square
underneath square 13 or 14 or 15 or 16

for that matter
so as we are checking the squares
directly below our square 

we need to
change this from checking
the square on the right of our square or
the square
down our array down one to check the
square directly one whole width down our
array 

okay
let's also change that here and finally
change that here

okay great now let's get to writing our
key down and key out functions 

so we can
pass them through to our control
function

so let's start with key down which is
made up of move
down combine column

move down again and generate

now the key up function so function key

up is made up up
move up combine column

move up again and generate in
that order 

now let's scroll to our
control function

else if key code deeply equals 38 so
this is for the key up function when we
press the arrow
up key and else if key code equal 40

this is for the key down function

okay let's save this all to see if it's
wired up correctly

and great we've done 

it everything looks
so good so far 

and i'm so pleased with
how far we've come

we only have a few extra things to do
now 

and that is check for a win and
check for a lose

so let's do this so let's
scroll down to the bottom of our code 

we
will start by writing the function to
check
if one of our squares has reached a
total of two for a
so function check for win

we need to loop over all our squares so
as long as i
is smaller than our square's array
length 

we increment by one

now if this square we are looping over

its inner html equals
so two equals remember as we want it to
be true 

if it's a string or a number
we want the inner html of our result
display to

say you win 

we also want to stop the
keys from working 

so we can easily do
this by removing the event listener
that is you know listening out for the
key up events and invoking the control
functions

so we do that like this

now this is done 

we need to decide where
we want to check for the win 

right so
well i guess it makes sense to check for
when each time
a row or column is combined

so let's go ahead and put the checks to
both of those functions at the end

okay and that is done nice

let's save this file actually 

let's
change the win amount so we can test
this quicker rather than going all the
way up to 2048.

i'm going to make the win amount 8.

okay let's save this and go to our
browser and let's
start playing 

so i'm currently swiping
all different directions
until i get an eight 

and great
there we have it you get a win pop-up in
our browser

let's flip over now and put the number
back

before we forget so 2048

now let's write our game over function
or technically a check for game over
function

we need to check if there are no zeros
on our board

okay so if there are no zeros on the
board we lose

so function check for game over

let's make a variable called zeros here

let's make it equal zero for now now

let's loop over all our squares but as
we loop

we want to add one to our zeros variable
using the increment operator

we're basically counting up how many
zeros we have on the grid so
if the square we are looping it's inner
html equals zero

we add one to the zeros variable now
after we run this loop 

and only after
we've run this loop over all the squares
we want to check if the zero is deeply
equal
zero and if they do and this is true i
want to display the text
you lose in the result display in html

then just like in the check for win
function i want to remove the event
listener that allows us to swipe

okay now before we check this we need to
decide where to invoke it

i reckon after each time we generate a
number as a good shout

let's scroll to our generate function
and add it to the bottom

okay great now i'm actually gonna
quickly add a score here as well

so let's scroll to the top and let's
score be equal to zero

now how does a score work well each time

we combine a row we actually get the
score of the combined total so that's
easy right 

let's head over to our
combined functions

and after we get the combined total

let's also add this combined total to
the score
using the plus and equals 

we then also
want to display this score

let's do it in the inner html of our
score display

let's do the same for the combine
columns function

so again adding the combined total to
score and updating the score on our
score display

okay great let's save this and start
playing

now i'm going to swipe a lot here as we
need to keep swiping and swiping until
we have no zeros visible on the board

if we get to a point 

where there are no
zeros a you lose
should be visible here in our browser we
would have completed our game
of 2048 if this works 

and we're ready to
style it up
amazing 

we have now finished our game of
204
h 

now it's time for you to take the game
and fully make your own

please go well on the styling 

i can't
wait to see what you guys have made

this is something i baked a little
earlier

so if you want to check it out please do
but yeah please hit me up if you have
any questions

if you want to share your games with me

please use my twitter or youtube
handles 

and thank you so much for
watching 

i can't wait
to see what you guys have made
