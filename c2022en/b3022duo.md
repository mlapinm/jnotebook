Praise yourself you deserve it

Let me congratulate you on achieving your goal

Our hard work has been rewarded with your success

All your efforts were worth it my sincere congratulations

I heard you won congratulations

This are just first successful steps you will achieve more

This success is the result of your efforts

Take the next step toward your goal and you will be rewarded

My cat is from London and she likes ballet

This success is the result of your efforts

Don't worry I have one dog but no three

Don't worry I speak a little English

Excuse me is this your boyfriend

Oh he has a strange sense of humor

He's nice but he has a wife and a son

Do you have any dresses here

here's your ticket see you later

Of course I need a ride

How about a meeting on Tuesday

Oh when's the basketball game

I need coffee is there a restaurant nearby?

no milk

I clean every Sunday or every Monday

I like to cook alone

Do you have any dresses here

Sorry these dresses are terrible

The party starts at three o'clock not four

I work at eight o'clock

I need help is there a doctor in this cafe

straight tuesday ballet

These shirts are really nice
