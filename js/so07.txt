Corleone Speaking (оригинал Silicon Dream)
Pronto!

Who's speaking?

This is a long distance call from... from Chicago

Corleone speaking

Chicago is hot
The whiskey is not
In The Summer of 29...

Gangs in the street
Gambling in heat
Big boss still on the line
Mamma a napoli
Far across the sea

Corleone speaking

Police on the run
From winchester gun
The city is on fire
New York to Frisco
Let the news go
On talking wire
Mamma a napoli
Far across the sea

Corleone speaking

Midnight in town
Limousines around
In the summer of 29
Hotel Ritz
Ballroom blitz
Big boss still on the line
Mamma a napoli
Far across the sea
Corleone speaking

Corleone speaking

Pronto
Who's speaking

I got two strong arms
Blessings of babylon
With time to carry on
And try
For sins and alarms
So to america the brave
Wise men save
Near a tree by a river
There's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of aran
Goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon
In the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
Near a tree by a river
There's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of aran
Goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon
In the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you
Near a tree by a river
There's a hole in the ground
Where a old man of aran
Goes around an around
And his mind is a beacon
In the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
Near a tree by a river
There's a hole in the ground
Where a old man of aran
Goes around an around
And his mind is a beacon
In the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you
I got plans for us
Nights in the scullery
And day instead of me
I only know what to discuss
Of for anything but light
Wise men fighting over you
It's not me you see
Pieces of valentine
With just a song of mine
To keep from burning history
Seasons of gasoline and gold
Wise men fold
Near a tree by a river
There's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of aran
Goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon
In the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you
I got time to kill
Sly looks in corridors
Without a plan of yours
A blackbird sings on bluebird hill
Thanks to the calling of the wild
Wise mens child

You Can't Touch This* (M.C. Hammer)
You can't touch this [4x]

My-my-my-my (You can't touch this) music hits me so hard
Makes me say,"oh my lord thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet"
It feels good
When you know you're sown
A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat-uh!
You can't touch this


I told you homeboy
You can't touch this
Yeah, that's how we livin' and you know
You can't touch this
Look in my eyes,man
You can't touch this
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics
You can't touch this

Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that now you know you wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rolling
Hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on
Like that
Like that
Cold on a mission so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat
They can't touch

Yo! I told you
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Yo,sound the bells, school is in, sucker
You can't touch this

Give me a song or rhythm
Making 'em sweat
That's what I'm giving'em
Now they know
You talk about the Hammer, you're talking about a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweating so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What it is going to take in the '90s
To burn the charts
Legit either work hard or you might as well quit

That's the word,because you know
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Break it down

Stop. . . Hammer time

Go with the funk
It is said
That if you can't groove to this
Then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it for a winter
Dance to this an' you're gonna get thinner
Move slide your rump
Just for a minute, let's all do the bump
Bump bump bump

Yeah, You can't touch this
Look man, You can't touch this
You better get hyped
Boy 'cause you know ya can't
You can't touch this

Please don't go. Please don't go
I don't wanna be all alone
Say you're mine and give me tonight
Let's stay together
Please don't go. Please don't go
You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever
No, no! No, no!
If you leave me
You let a good thing fall apart
If you decive me
You leave a pain inside my heart
I really need you
Just like the air I need to breathe
I'll stand beside you; I'll never leave
Please don't go. Please don't go
I don't wanna be all alone
Say you're mine and give me tonight

You're gonna spoil a dream we shared
If you leave me
I'm gonna miss the way you care
I will try harder
I'll make you fall in love again
And I'll be faithful until the end
Please don't go. Please don't go
(Don't go!)
You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever
No, no!
If you leave me I'm gonna search the world for you
If you leave me
Sweet memories will shine on through
I'll always love you,
No matter what you do or say
Cos when I touch you
Night turns to day
Please don't go. Please don't go
Don't you know that I love you so?
Say you're mine and give me tonight
Let's stay together
Please don't go. Please don't go
You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever
No, no!

When you're feeling all right
Everything is upt-ight
Try to sing a song that goes Ding-Ding-A-Dong.
There will be no sorrow
When you sing tomorrow
And you walk along with your Ding-Ding-Dong.
Dinge-Dong
every hour
when you pick a flower
Even when your lover is gone
gone
gone.
Dinge-Dong
listen to it
maybe it's a big hit.
Even when your lover is gone
gone
gone
sing Ding-Ding-Dong.
Источник teksty-pesenok.ru
When you're feeling all right . . .
And the world looks sunny
Everyone is funny
When they sing a song that goes Ding-Ding-Dong.
Dinge-Dong
every hour . . .
Ding-Dang-Dong
Dinge-Dang-Dong
When you think it's all over
They let me down;
Dry your tears and forget all your sorrow
Try to smile when you'tl say good-bye.
Ding-Dang-Ding-Dong
Ding-Dong-Dong
When you wake up tomorrow
Well
the sun is up in the sky.
When you're feeling all right . . .

I Like Chopin (оригинал Gazebo)
Remember that piano
So delightful unusual
That classic sensation
Sentimental confusion

Used to say
I like Chopin
Love me now and again

[Chorus:]
Rainy days never say goodbye

To desire when we are together
Rainy days growing in your eyes
Tell me where's my way

Imagine your face
In a sunshine reflection
A vision of blue skies
Forever distractions

Used to say
I like Chopin
Love me now and again

[Chorus:]
Rainy days never say goodbye
To desire when we are together
Rainy days growing in your eyes
Tell me where's my way


I Like Chopin

Used to say

Tell me where's my way

Imagine your face

Love me now and again
О-о

Rainy days never say goodbye
To desire when we are together
Rainy days growing in your eyes
Tell me where's my way
