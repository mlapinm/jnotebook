Big in Japan (Alphaville)
Winter's cityside
Crystal bits of snowflakes
All around my head and in the wind
I had no illusions
That I'd ever find a glimpse
Of summer's heatwaves in your eyes
You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight

It's easy when you're big in Japan

Ah when you're big in Japan tonight
Big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, ooh the eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan, alright
Pay then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan
Oh when you're big in Japan

Neon on my naked skin,
Passing silhouettes
Of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo
Or should I go and change my point of view
For other ugly scenes
You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're big in Japan

Ah when you're big in Japan tonight
Big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, ooh the eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan, alright
Pay then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan

S.O.S. (La Bouche)
Sending you an S.O.S of love,
You're all I'm thinking of,
Would you be mine,
Be my destiny tonight

Sending you an S.O.S of love,
You're all I'm thinking of,
Would you be mine,
Be my destiny, my everything in love

Every night before I turn out the light

I get down on my knees
And I pray for the day,
When we can become
A little closer to one
And maybe then you'd be ready,
Ready to hear my S.O.S.,
Can you see that I am...

Dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot

Just when I knew that I was in love with you,
I thought how could it be that I would deny
The chance to express and offer you happiness
And baby, now I am ready,
Oh won't you hear my S.O.S.
Can't you see that I am....

So I'm sending you S.O.S of love tonight
Dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot

Destiny it’s here for you, it's here for me,
Sending out an S.O.S of love divine,
On the line give it to you
Rain or shine,
In my mind it’s you I want, you I need
Girl, you I crave

Dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot

So hear my S.O.S
I'll send it with a kiss from me,
S.O.S I love the way you touch my body,
Now that I found you, I'll never let you go
And that's why I am....

I'm not your Juliet, and you're not Romeo
But I will love you,baby, time will show
I'l give you everything
And that's no compromise
See my broken wings
To your alibies
Crying ninety tears no sacrifice
Broken souvenirs in paradise
Oh,I never promised you love
Oh,when my heart is not enough
Oh, it's like an ocean of love to me
I'm not your Romeo and you're not Juliet
After the curtain falls
I'll drive you mad
Oh,baby,heaven just sweet heaven has sent you
I'm not your Romeo and you're not Juliet
But I will love you,love you,love you
Drive you mad
Oh,baby,there will never be another you
Love on the telephone, it's killing me
I'l sail my ship alone
Old memory
Back to Babilon, in my fantasy
Gonna lock my heart and losing the key
Oh,I never promised you love
Oh, when my heart is not enough
Oh, it's like an ocean of love to me
I'm not your Romeo and you're not Juliet
After the curtain falls
I'll drive you mad
Oh, baby, heaven just sweet heaven has sent you
I'm not your Romeo and you're not Juliet
But I will love you,love you,love you
Drive you mad
Oh,baby,there will never be another you
Another you
Another you

There's a boy in my mind and he knows
I am thinking of him
All my way through the day and the night
Stars shine above me
He's been gone for sum time
But i know i truley love him
And iam singing a song
Hoping he'll be back when he hears it
My heart goes shalalala shalala in the morning
Shalalala shalala in the sunshine
Shalalala shalala in the evening
Shalalala shalala just for you!(make sum noise for the vengaboys!)
If your lucks gone away just like mine
You feel like crying
Sing along maybe once
Maybe twice lets try it together
Sum sweet day no one knows you'll return and you'll be happy
Shouting sweet in a song
Listen to your heart it is singing
My heart goes shalalala shalala in the morning
Shalalala shalala in the sunshine
Shalalala shalala in the evening
Shalalala shalala just for you!
My heart goes shalalala shalala in the morning
Shalalala shalala in the sunshine
Shalalala shalala in the evening
Shalalala shalala just for you!
Shalalala shalala just for you!

I Will Survive* (оригинал Gloria Gaynor)
First I was afraid, I was petrified!
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong,
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along.

And so you're back from outerspace,
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I shoulda changed that stupid lock, I shoulda made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me.

Go on now go, walk out the door.

Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I! I will survive!
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive.
I've got all my life to live,
And I've got all my love to give,

I'll survive, I will survive!
Hey hey..

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart,
And tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart.
And I spent oh so many nights just feelin' sorry for myself, I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high,

And you'll see me, somebody new;
I'm not that chained up little girl who's still in love with you.
So you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free,
But now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me,

Go on now go, walk out the door.
Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I! I will survive!
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
And I've got all my love to give,

I'll survive, I will survive!
Oh..

Go on now go, walk out the door.
Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I! I will survive!
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
And I've got all my love to give,

I'll survive, I will survive!
I'll survive.

In the Heat of the Night (оригинал Sandra)
Talk to me - want my love.
Talk to me - but not that stuff.
You ain't get enough using my love.
You call for me again, l see.

In the heat of the night
You lose control and sell your soul
I lose control in the heat of the night
It's much too late to leave the trade
But I can't stand it anymore
You lose your heart and sell your soul

I lose control in the heat of the night

In the heat of the night.

Talk to me - want my love.
Talk to me - but not that stuff

Who's on my side losing my pride?
You call for me again, I see.

In the heat of the night
You lose control and sell your soul
I lose control in the heat of the night
It's much too late to leave the trade
But I can't stand it anymore
You lose your heart and sell your soul
I lose control in the heat of the night

In the heat of the night. [2x]

You lose control and sell your soul
It's much too late to leave the trade.

Mambo Italiano (оригинал Dean Martin)
A boy went back to Napoli because he missed the scenery
The native dances and the charming songs
But wait a minute, something's wrong
'Cause now it's

Hey mambo, mambo italiano
Hey, hey, mambo, mambo Italiano
Go, go, go, you mixed up Siciliano
All you Calabrese do the mambo like-a crazy with the

Hey mambo, don't wanna tarantella

Hey mambo, no more mozzarella
Hey mambo, mambo Italiano
Try an enchilada with a fish baccala

Hey goomba, I love how you dance the rumba
But take some advice, paisano
Learn-a how to mambo
If you're gonna be a square
You ain't-a gonna go anywhere

Hey mambo, mambo italiano
hey, hey mambo, mambo italiano
Go, go Joe, shake like a tiavanna
E lo che si dice, you get happy in the pizza
When you Mambo italiano

Hey chadrool, you don't-a have to go to the school
Just make it with a big bambino
It's like vino
Kid, you good-a looking
But you don't-a know what's cooking till you

Hey mambo, mambo italiano
Hey, hey mambo, mambo italiano
Ho, ho, ho, you mixed up Siciliano
E lo che si dice, you get happy in the pizza
When you mambo italiano!
