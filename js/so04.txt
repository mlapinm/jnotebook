Mister
Your eyes are full of hesitation
Sure makes me wonder
If you know what you're looking for.
Baby
I wanna keep my reputation
I'm a sensation
You try me once, you'll beg for more.

Yes Sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song.

I can boogie, boogie woogie
All night long.
Yes Sir, I can boogie,
If you stay, you can't go wrong.
I can boogie, boogie woogie, all night long

No Sir,
I don't feel very much like talking
No, neither walking
You wanna know if I can dance.
Yes Sir, already told you in the first verse
And in the chorus
But I will give you one more chance.

Yes Sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song.
I can boogie, boogie woogie
All night long.
Yes Sir, I can boogie,
If you stay, you can't go wrong.
I can boogie, boogie woogie, all night long

Moving up together
So don't forget it never
I will give you my soul
You'll let me keep on music
Fall in love forever
With you and I together
I will kiss you my darling
But let me keep on music
This in me I dream
With caresses I'll touch you
I will present my heart
But let me keep on music
Everything you like it
And everywhere you bring me
I will leave you my body
But let me keep on music
Every night
I'll be living to feel right
Sing forever
You'll feel it paradise
So you will dance forever
You can take my style

Live
live is life
live
live.
When we all give the power
we all give the best.
Every minute of an hour
don't think about a rest.
Then you all get the power
you all get the best.
When everyone gives everything and every song everybody sings.
Then it's live
live is life
live is life
live.
Live is life - when we all feel the power.
Live is life - come on
stand up and dance!
Live is life - when the feeling of the people -
Live is life - is the feeling of the band.
When we all give the power
we all give the best. . . .
Then it's live
live is life
live
live is life
live.
Live
live is life
live
live is life.
And you call when it's over
you call it should last.
Every minute of the future is a memory of the past.
'Cause we all gave the power
we all gave the best.
And everyone gave everything and every song everybody sang.
Live is life.

What my heart wanna say
Laid in my dreams from yesterday
That's not my world can't you see?
I don't believe you go away
All you want is to be free
I know you do, what you have to do
You're looking for a new life
Maybe one time you will understand me
Our luck is more than to be free
Can't you feel what my heart wanna say
I love you, but you don't have to stay
You can go but I hope you'll come back
Cause your love I will never forget
As I know one day you will be mine
Please don't keep me waiting a long time
Can't you feel what my heart wanna say
I love you, but you don't have to stay
You can go but I hope you'll come back
Cause your love I will never forget
As I know one day you will be mine
Please don't keep me waiting a long time
I want you more than I can say
And it's alway been this way
I know you do, what you have to do
You're looking for a new life
Maybe one time you will understand me
Our luck is more than to be free
Can't you feel what my heart wanna say
I love you, but you don't have to stay
You can go but I hope you'll come back
Cause your love I will never forget
As I know one day you will be mine
Please don't keep me waiting a long time
Can't you feel what my heart wanna say
I love you, but you don't have to stay
You can go but I hope you'll come back
Cause your love I will never forget
As I know one day you will be mine
Please don't keep me waiting a long time

You're a Woman (оригинал Bad Boys Blue)
Tonight,
They'll be no darkness tonight.
Hold tight,
Let your love light shine bright.

Listen to my heart,
And lay your body next to mine.
Let me fill your soul,
With all my tears.

You're a woman, I'm a man.

This is more than just a game.
I can make you feel so right.
Be my lady of the night.
You're a woman, I'm a man.
You're my fortune, I'm your fame.
These are things we can't disguise.
Be my lady of the night.

Lay back,
Back in my tenderness.
And take,
Take all of my sweet caress.

You've got all of me.
It can't go wrong if you agree.
Soon two hearts will beat in ecstasy.

You're a woman, I'm a man.
This is more than just a game.
I can make you feel so right.
Be my lady of the night.
You're a woman, I'm a man.
You're my fortune, I'm your fame.
These are things we can't disguise.
Be my lady

These are things we can't disguise.
Be my lady...
