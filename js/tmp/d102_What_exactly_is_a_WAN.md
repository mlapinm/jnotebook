[BLANK_AUDIO]
All right.
We're almost at the finish line.
Now, it's time for wide area networks.
But oh, by the way, welcome back.
But what, I'm gonna start this session out for this lesson with a question.
What is a WAN?
What's the definition of WAN?
What do you think?
Is it a, the distance between locations.
B, speed to use, speed use to source.
How did I read that backwards?
Speed used to source to source and destination.
Yeah, the speed used to get from the source and destination.
Wow, okay.
And you lease a wan or you own a WAN.
So which one of these would be the correct answer.
Well, what was that?
You said c, you would be correct.
Very good.
You lease a WAN.
Outstanding.
So this would be your answer and let me tell you why.
Because now, it used to be, you know, when you take, like network plus classes,
we were, way long, long time ago, they teach you that.
Hey, a WAN, since it's wide area network is in different geographic locations.
Right?
You got your WAN, you have your man.
As far as Cisco concern, Cisco is concerned, it's a WAN or a LAN, period.
All right?
You don't own a WAN.
If you do, I guess you got that kinda money.
All right?
[LAUGH] But normally, you lease it.
And there's different ways of leasing it,
we'll get into that for the next lesson as far as the connection types.
But the distance between locations, that really doesn't matter.
Because if I got that kind of cash and I can connect, you know,
a fiber cable or a wire, you know,
microwave or have a radio tower.
However, I wanna, you know, send the signal out to,
from point a to point b and it's my equipment, I own it.
That's really a LAN, even though we would technically call it a WAN,
because we're using WAN protocols.
But if you own that infrastructure, it wouldn't be a WAN speed use.
Again, the speeds nowadays, you have, you have Gigabit wireless for God sakes.
So really is not the speed anymore.
Usually, the WANs were a lot slower than the LANs.
But that's gone, that's nowadays with Metro E and all these different types of connections.
That goals, that pales beyond comparison anymore.
So the speed is no longer, the an issue anymore.
And as far as leasing a WAN, that is the correct answer.
You lease an infrastructure.
You're not gonna go out there and run your own fiber.
You're not gonna put on, you know,
you're not gonna bundle a bunch of t ones yourself.
Go run them into where you need to.
No.
You go to a provider.
That's gonna get you from point a to point b.
Now depending on how you get from point a to point b, that's a different story.
All right?
But you lease it and you don't own a WAN.
If you do, hey man, that's awesome.
You know, you've got your own satellite there, man.
You're shooting things up to a satellite and coming back down could be your own satellite, you shot it into space, you got
that kind of cash.
But that's what a WAN is, right?
In the background here, I have one of the labs that you will be doing.
Not right now, but you will be doing it.
All right?
This is your WAN.
Here's your LANs, right?
And they're connected via serial cables to a WAN.
Now, again the connection types we'll discuss.
But normally, it's not serial cables.
Everything is turning into Ethernet connectivity.
There's no, no longer T1s, you know,
where you would bundle bunch of T1s to get, you know, bigger speeds.
Now we're going, you know, straight up fiber connections.
So definitely, a lot of things have changed.
A lot of things have changed.
Coming from or being in the telecommunication industry seeing the change that went on there, cuz that was in a transition period within
the telecommunications industry and seeing everything going to Ethernet.
So definitely, it's not gonna be serial connections going to your WAN.
But for the CCNA purposes, this is how they portray it.
Anytime you see a cloud or you maybe see two routers connected with a serial cable,
that is a symbol usually for wide area networks.
So, it's just symbolic.
So when you see that lightning bolt going from one side to the next,
that's usually is representing a wide area network.
And when you see a cloud, that definitely represents some sort of, you know,
internet or wide area network,
because within that cloud is where you have the providers infrastructure.
They have their servers.
Their routers, their switches to take you from point a to point b.
They're the ones who are doing that.
The way you go about it, that's a different story and we'll get into that in the next lesson.
But that's what a WAN is, that's it.
Definitely WANs, they work at layer two and layer one of the OSI model,
because you're looking at, again, the connection type.
What protocols, because protocols such as HDLC, PPP,
all these or MPLS, all these protocols work at layer two.
They work at layer two and layer one.
So when you're using those protocols,
definitely you are using a wide area network.
Okay?
So this is it.
This is just an introduction telling you hey, this is a wide area network and now we're gonna start configuring wide area networks.
Now just to give you a heads up.
For the CCNA examination, which is what the goal of this course is,
is to take your CCNA certification exam,
the 200-120 exam.
All right.
For the CCNA, they are still testing frame relay and PPP.
They are not testing for MPLS, at least not yet, okay?
Or anything else like that.
You need to know just those two types and that's what I'm going to focus on, all right?
You need to understand, this was where the wow.
The DCE and the DTE, right?
Data communications equipment.
Data terminating equipment.
This is where, this all comes in.
All right.
Anyway, so this is your WAN.
Next lesson, we're gonna start getting circulation types and then I'll ex,
I'll elaborate, cuz this is really a drawing I have there.
Now, I didn't draw it.
It's from the page in the book that I'm gonna show you and then I'll explain what they're talking about in terms of DOS connection types.
And why would you use it and why wouldn't you use it and how would you justify it using that type of connection.
I'll see you in the next lesson.
