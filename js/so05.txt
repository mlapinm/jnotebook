Station, happy station
Very special people you can meet at the station
Station, happy station (oh, happy station)
Glad and smiling faces come from different places
My suitcase and me we'll take a trip
It's a magic journey, I feel like burning
Lucky guy, follow me, you'll be alright
I'm crazy, don't you know
I'll never let you go
Would you like to do it?
Well, it's not, not too late
Tell me what you like
It could be so fine.
Come into my train, I can get you higher
You're the best, best, honey
The best, best lover tonight
Station, happy station?
Come with me and take the train
I don't want to stop here, wanna go there
(Go where?)
Where I'd like to see one million places
(What kind of places?)
Midnight is coming, follow me
Station, happy station?
Come with me and take the train...

I love your world
Where the winners might be sweet all around
Tell me your life.
Tell me what you'll be afraid of this night
If you wanna take a look around
Please don't hit a man who understands
As the story goes you are the one
Run away in other place
In the night you're looking for to meet
And checking the man to get in fit
Just the story goes you are the one
Run away in other place
Yeti, yeti, yeti, yeti
Yeti, looking a horrid man.
Yeti, living in other land
I want your soul and I really like to seem to your heart
I feel with you and I know that you are living apart
If you wanna take a look around...

And now Im sitting here like a fool

Hoh! Nowhere to running
Nowhere to go
Hoh! Enjoy the party
With the rest of the crew
Cause what we do, we do it for you
Dont stand around, come on, just kick it
Cause when were in the house
You know were getting wicked
Lets have a party
Cause we love you so
Dont go away
Please stay by my side
Just hold me tight
I wanna be with you tonight
Dont go away and show me your love
You bring me joy
You are the center of my life

Blue (Eiffel 65)
[Intro:]
Yo, listen up, here's a story
About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue
Like him inside and outside
Blue his house with a blue little window and a blue Corvette
And everything is blue for him
And himself and everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen (to listen)

[Hook: 2x]

I'm Blue
Da ba dee da ba dye [7x]

[Verse 1:]
I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the color of all that I wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue
Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my Corvette that's standing outside
Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me

[Hook: 2x]
I'm Blue
Da ba dee da ba dye [7x]

[Verse 1:]
I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the color of all that I wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too

Blue are the words I say and what I think

And everything is blue for him

'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen (to listen)

Bam, Bam, Bam! (Floricienta)
Todos juntos vamos ya
a bailar con ese compás:
para el frente y para atrás,
hacia abajo y a volar.

En la playa, en la montaña,
en el valle, en la ciudad,
cuando Flori se descalza
comienza la danza.

[Estribillo:]

Un, dos, tres.
¡Arriba!
Un, dos, tres.
¡Hey, derecha!
Un, dos, un, dos, tres.
¡Menea!
Un, dos, un, dos, tres.
¡Bam, bam, bam!
Un, dos, tres.
¡Uh, abajo!
Un, dos, tres.
¡Izquierda!
Un, dos, un, dos, tres.
¡Arriba!
Un, dos, tres.
¡Bam, bam!

Ahora que sabés bailar,
animáte a conquistar.
Todo el mundo es para vos.
Es tu hora de soñar.

En la calle, en la oficina,
en un bar, en cada esquina,
cuando Flori se descalza
comienza la danza.

[Estribillo:]

No Limit (оригинал 2 Unlimited)
Let me hear us say yeah! (wow!)

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no there's no limit!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no there's no limit!

No, no limits, we'll reach for the sky!
No valley too deep,
No mountain too high,
No, no limits, won't give up the fight!

We do what we want
And we do it with pride

Let me hear us say yeah! (wow!)

Hard to the core, I feel the floor,
When I'm on stage, yo, ya answer more,
I'm on the edge, I know the ledge,
I work real hard to collect my cash!
Tick tick tick tick tаke your time,
When I'm going I'm going for mine,
Open your ears and you will hear it,
I tell you this 'cause there's no limit!

No limits allowed,
Cause there's much crowd,
Microphone check as I choose my route

I'm playing on the road, I've got no fear,
The sounds from my mouth is on record here,
There never will be no mountain too high,
Reach the top, touch the sky!
They tried to diss me
Cause I sell out...
I'm making techno and I am proud!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no ,no , no there's no limit!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no there's no limit!

No, no limits, we'll reach for the sky!
No valley too deep,
No mountain too high,
No, no limits, won't give up the fight!
We do what we want
And we do it with pride

Ice Ice Baby (Vanilla Ice)
All right stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly flow
like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop? Yo - I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.

Dance, bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom

deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gain way
You better hit bull's eye, the kid don't play
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you aint quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, waving just to say Hi
Did you stop? No - I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo - so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave.
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out geting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine - all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene, You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, you, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake, kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast, other DJs say, "damn"
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem, Yo - I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it.

All my friends often say
I should leave you alone
I'd like to see you again
When they tell me I'm wrong
Cause your heart's made of stone
I know they're right in the end
But you move to my dreams
Like a warm summer wind
Is not good to retain or just a lie
And the touch of your hand
Like a breeze on my skin
It's stronger than a warm wind in the sky
Storms of love - a gentle power
Storms of love without the charms
Storms of love
Like a preach it can bring me to my knees
I'm helpless when I'm longing to your arms
Storms of love - a restless flyer
Storms of love - a hurricane
Storms of love
In my heart they are tearing me apart
And I lose my control again
When I try and I try
Not to see you again
I change my apartment downtown
Call some girls late at night
Throw a party to friends
Music and fun all around
So I'm telling myself
Not to think about you
But my memory has lost a hopeless fight
And I'm safe and I'm strong
And then I'll make it through
A lonesome heart against the stormy night

Comanchero, comanchero, comanchero, comanchero-o
Oh can you see, he is the one
Day after day, he is riding in the sun
He's travelling through deserts all alone
I will bring the comanchero his tomahawk
His lonesome walk, his lonesome walk
Who's in mind of comanchero: a man of law
A pretty squaw, a pretty squaw
Comanchero, comanchero, comanchero, comanchero-o
Comanchero, comanchero, comanchero, comanchero-o
I will bring the comanchero his tomahawk
His lonesome walk, his lonesome walk
Who's in mind of comanchero: a man of law
A pretty squaw, a pretty squaw
Who will join the comanchero where eagles fly
Where horses ride, where horses ride
Will the road take comanchero to his tee-pee
Or to the sea, or to the sea
Comanchero, comanchero, comanchero, comanchero-o

As a break of dawn came closer
AII my hopes seemed so forlorn
The misty signs of laughter
And the light eluded all
And my despair was caught in motion
A face just barely true
Shadows in blue
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
In the changing of the season
Releasing one lost name
And the scar once healed forever
Dissolving in the rain
A twig snapped in the clearing
A glimpse of golden skin
My face within
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
And my despair was caught in motion
A face just barely true
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
As a break of dawn came closer
AII my hopes seemed so forlorn
The misty signs of laughter
And the light eluded all
And my despair was caught in motion
A face just barely true
Shadows in blue
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
In the changing of the season
Releasing one lost name
And the scar once healed forever
Dissolving in the rain
A twig snapped in the clearing
A glimpse of golden skin
My face within
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
And my despair was caught in motion
A face just barely true
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
