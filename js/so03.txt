What Is Love? (Haddaway)
[Chorus:]
What is love
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love

Yeah


Oh I don't know
Why you're not fair
I give you my love
But you don't care
So what is right
And what is wrong
Gimme a sign

[Chorus: 2x]
What is love
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love

Uoh oh...

Oh I don't know
What can I do
What else can I say
It's up to you
I know we're one
Just me and you
I can't go on

[Chorus: 2x]
What is love
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love

Uoh oh..

What is love
What is love
What is love
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

I want no other
No other love
This is your life
Our time
When we are together
I need you forever
Is it love

[Chorus: 2x]
What is love
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love



Set the World on Fire (E-Type)

So I am what I am
What I feel cannot be wrong
This is the way that I feel and I'm coming on strong
We're talking hundreds and thousands
With potential to stay
But only one with quality
Can turn the loneliness away, come follow me

One is a wonder
One is a wonder
But only

One is a wonder
One is a wonder

Set the world on fire
I'll do anything to get what I want
Aim even higher
I'll do anything to be the one

So I'm cruising round the continent
To see what I can find
A lot of fangs, but I refuse to be a slave to the ground
We're talking gadda-da-vida,
Honey now the deed is done
And if you're in you've got to show me
That you really are the one
Come follow me

One is a wonder
One is a wonder
But only
One is a wonder
One is a wonder

(I'm gonna) Set the world on fire
I'll do anything to get what I want
(I'm gonna) aim even higher
I'll do anything to be the one



Coco Jambo (Mr. President)
[Chorus:]
Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, take my heart
And make me happy
Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, feel my heart
And make me happy

Ayyayaya Coco Jambo ayyayai


Here we go
Gettin' smooth to the groove
Showing lovely ladies
How I soothе as I move
That's what they say
But I can't prove
So turn it up again and watch me
Move to the groove
As we get close
You whisper coco
I hold you in my arms
And you say Jamboo
Scream and shout
Turn and say columbo
Now I gotta go so coco

[Chorus]

That's the way I treat dem girls
Kinda smooth see
'Cos there's one man
And yo! that's me see
So let me show you round
As you sip your teа gee
But no coco
Loco boom
While I take a pee lee
When I hold my baby tighter
She says I do it nicer
I like my chicken
With rice and lemonada
And that's what you get
When she shout out Jamboo
Now I gotta go yo coco

Another night, another dream, but always you
It’s like a vision of love, it seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of love so true
Just another night (just another night)
Another night, another dream, but always you
It’s like a vision of love, it seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of love so true
In the night, in my dreams, I’m in love with you
'Cause you talk to me like lovers do
I I feel joy, I feel pain, 'cause it’s still the same
When the night is gone, I will be alone
Talk, talk, I’ll talk to you
In the night, in your dreams
Our love so true
Talk, talk, I’ll talk to you
In the night, in your dreams
Our love so true
Another night, another dream, but always you
It’s like a vision of love, it seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of love so true
Another night, another dream, but always you
It’s like a vision of love, it seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of love so true
In the night, in my dreams, I’m in love with you
'Cause you talk to me like lovers do When the night is gone, I will be alone
Just another night, it’s all that it takes
To understand the difference between lovers and fakes
So be there, be there
