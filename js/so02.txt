Flames of Love (оригинал Fancy)
What kind of man,
What kind of man am I
I try to walk where I just fell
I try to break a secret spells
In your eyes I feel
The flames of love

Flames of love, flames of love
I'm drowning in the sea of love
And enough is never enough
When I find myself deep in your eyes

Over and over again flames of love

What kind of fool,
What kind of fool am I
I look for shadows in the sun
Or memories of days to come
In your eyes I feel
The flames of love

Flames of love, flames of love
I'm drowning in the sea of love
And enough is never enough
When I find myself deep in your eyes
Over and over again flames of love

I surrender
To sweet death in your arms
In a wave of lustful life
You touch me so deep
I'm cry out melting in flames of love

Flames of love, flames of love
I'm drowning in the sea of love
And enough is never enough
When I find myself deep in your eyes
Over and over again flames of love


In the Army Now* (Status Quo)
A vacation in a foreign land
Uncle Sam does the best he can
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now
Now you remember what the draftman said
Nothing to do all day but stay in bed
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

You be the hero of the neiborhood

Nobody knows that you left for good
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Smiling faces as you wait to land
But once you get there no one gives a damn
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Hand grenades flying over your head
Missiles flying over your head
If you want to survive get out of bed
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Shots ring out in the dad of night
The sergeant calls: stand up and fight
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

You've got your orders better shoot on sight
Your finger's on the trigger
But it don't seem right
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Night is falling and you just can't see
Is this illusion or reality
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Oh, oh, you're in the army now



Now when I'm down on the microphone stand
I give you all the dope lyrics and
Introducing the band
To make you understand
How this is planned, I demand
A microphone to rock the home boys
With an instrumental to make noise
Yo, I rock the home girls too
I'll explain the name of the crew, yo
This beat is, this beat is
This beat is Technotronic
This beat is Technotronic
And Eric's got lyrics for ya
I saw ya posse
But now it's me who's bossing
So I give the orders around here
You don't wanna get sacked so be
A good party goer, get the floor ready
And yaself ready, huh, I rock steady
Like a rock and I won't stop
Till it's at the top and the suckers drop to hop to it
Yo, they couldn't do it, to get more to the point they blew it
But not like ya blowing the speaker
They can't go on because they're weaker
This beat is, this beat is
This beat is Technotronic
This beat is Technotronic
This beat is Technotronic
This beat is, this beat is
This beat is Technotronic
This beat is Technotronic
There's the dance floor, get on it
Now when I'm down on the microphone stand
I give you all the dope lyrics and
Introducing the band
To make you understand

A microphone to rock the home boys
With an instrumental to make noise
Yo, I rock the home girls too

It's a Sin (Pet Shop Boys)
When I look back upon my life
It's always with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame

For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common too
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin

Everything I've ever done

Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

At school they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed

For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common too
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin

Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

Father forgive me
I tried not to do it
Turned over a new leaf
Then tore right through it
Whatever you taught me
I didn't believe it
Father you fought me
'Cause I didn't care
And I still don't understand

So I look back upon my life
Forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame

For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common too
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin

Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to I
It's a sin

What about it Daddy Cool

Daddy Daddy Cool

Daddy Daddy Cool

She's crazy like a fool
What about it Daddy Cool
I'm crazy like a fool
What about it Daddy Cool

[Chorus]

She's crazy about her daddy
Oh she believes in him
She loves her daddy

She's crazy like a fool
What about it Daddy Cool
I'm crazy like a fool
What about it Daddy Cool

Fun factory - Doh Wah Diddy
Do Wah Diddy Diddy (Manfred Mann)
There she was just a-walkin' down the street, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"
Snappin' her fingers and shufflin' her feet, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"
She looked good (looked good), she looked fine (looked fine)
She looked good, she looked fine and I nearly lost my mind

Before I knew it she was walkin' next to me, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"
Holdin' my hand just as natural as can be, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"
We walked on (walked on) to my door (my door)
We walked on to my door, then we kissed a little more

Whoa-oh, I knew we was falling in love

Yes I did, and so I told her all the things I'd been dreamin' of

Now we're together nearly every single day, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"
A-we're so happy and that's how we're gonna stay, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

You're in my mind
Yeah, I'm a savage lover
Romantic fever in the middle of the night
You said, I know, you're counting my desire
Or let you go, my prisoner of love
Nothing to be afraid
There is nothing to be said
Everything will be right
Let yourself tonight...
Come to my desire
Are you ready for desire
Are you ready for desire
I'm coming near
I feel your body shiver
Turn out under, oh baby, I go wild
Do you still fear?
Your dreams are my desire
Someone up there is smiling on your love
Be careful girl, I'll find you in my love
Baby, can't you see the danger in my eyes?
Get closer girl, it's there behind the door
Maybe don't you know, I'm made here for your love
So I will never you go
I'm looking for desire
Come to my desire
Are you ready for desire
Are you ready for desire
Come to my desire
Are you ready for desire
Are you ready for desire
Nothing to be afraid
There is nothing to be said
Everything will be right
Let yourself tonight...
Come to my desire
Are you ready for desire
Are you ready for desire
Be careful girl, I'll find you in my love
Baby, can't you see the danger in my eyes?
Get closer girl, it's there behind the door
Maybe don't you know, I'm made here for your love
So I will never you go
I'm looking for desire



I
Remember all the cries
It's a secret dream
I'm lost in your love
You
Your lonesome eyes are all I wanna know
Helpless tears
Can never stop the rain
Only you can turn my life
Can turn it just this way
REFRAIN:
Touch in the night
It feels like heaven
Touch in the night
So lucky in love
Lost in your light
Another secret
Touch in the night
Whatever I do
You
My angel in disguise
Deep inside my heart
Like the inner light
I
Believe in all your promise and your lies
But I feel
In the end I'll lose
Only you can turn my life
Can turn it just this way
Tonight I feel, I feel for you
Tonight I call, I'm calling your name
Tonight I feel, I feel for you - tonight
Touch in the night
It feels like heaven
Touch in the night
So lucky in love
Tonight I feel, I feel for you
Tonight I call, I'm calling your name
Tonight I feel, I feel for you - tonight
Only you can turn my life
Can turn it just this way
Touch in the night
It feels like heaven
Touch in the night
So lucky in love
Tonight I feel, I feel for you
Touch in the night
Tonight I call, I'm calling your name
Touch in the night
Tonight I feel, I feel for you
Touch in the night
Tonight I call, I'm calling your name
Touch in the night
Tonight I feel, I feel for you
Touch in the night
Tonight
