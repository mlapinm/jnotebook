negotiating a deal
yes. this is very important 
how much will it cost if I only buy one 
and if I buy two, will it be cheaper 
if I buy two it will be cheaper 
okay, thank you
wow, it sounded like you were ordering something very important for your company 
well it's very important but not for my company 
it sounded very important
what did you order 
I ordered two pizzas
I'm miss lunch, I'm very hungry
I see. I see 
I heard the test went very well 
are you happy with our product 
yes
I'm very happy with your product and I hope I will be happy with the cost 
well, that's what we are going to talk about today the cost 
will your product be very expensive or will it be cheap 
expensive or cheap 
well, our product cost is a little high but don't forget you will have more production and better quality, so you will not lose money 
but how much will it cost 
well that depends on how much you order 
if you order a lot, the cost will be a little lower 
and if I order a little bit 
if you order only a little bit, the cost will be higher 
so how much does it cost 
well. one bottle of our product costs about $20 
Oh, Marge. that's very expensive 
but don't forget we can negotiate the price
you mean I can bargain with you 
yes, and I can discount the price for you
great 
but 
I knew you would say that 
but
you must order a lot to get a good price
and if I order just a little bit 
I said before the price will be high 
and what are the terms of payment 
well you have a one-year contract 
okay. and you can make one large payment or you can divide into monthly payments 
let's see I would 
much rather pay by month 
no problem 
that's okay
how much will 500 bottles cost per month
500 bottles. 
okay. let's see
there you go. how's that 
that's not bad
but
this is better 
ah, well 
you can buy our
product at this price only if you buy one thousand bottles
six hundred 
eight hundred and fifty
seven hundred 
seven hundred and fifty
it's a deal 
okay
well, you are very good at bargaining, Mark 
well, you can negotiate the price very well also, Jim
thank you 
well, I guess everything is finished then 
okay. I know you will be very happy with our product 
I hope I can agree with you but if there are any problems 
I have your guarantee 
yes you have my guarantee if you have any problems please call me and I will come to help you 
okay. thank you very much 
I will talk to you soon, Mark
