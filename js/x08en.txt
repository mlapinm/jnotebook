[instrumental music]
How we doing? You guys ready?
So, mom already called this morning
to remind me not to wear my hair up.
Did you know my ears were not my best feature?
Some days it's all I can think about.
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find my bearings.
Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
What did I say?
[Rachel clears throat]
- Are these the shoes? - Yes.
Paolo sent them from It.
What we.. We don't have shoes here?
Morning, are we ready to go?
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up.
It's stuff like that, isn't it?
[instrumental music]
[dramatic music]
(Monica) It was really a beautiful service.
It really was.
Oh, come here, sweetheart.
You know
I think it might be time you to start using night cream.
- What? - Nothing, nothing.
Just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Musburger.
Check it out.
Giants, Cowboys.
You're watching a football game at a funeral.
No, it's the pre-game.
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
You're a frightening, frightening man.
Oh, no. My new Paolo shoes.
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
God, what a great day.
What? Weather-wise.
I know, yeah..
...the air, the trees.
Even though Nana's gone there's-there's
something almost uh, I don't know, almost li--
- Ross! - Oh, Ross, are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine. - Oh.
I'm just-just
having my worst fear realized.

[instrumental music]
Hey, gorgeous. How's it going?
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights.
Does it get better than this?
Question, you're not dating anybody, are you?
Because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Ah, you see, perfect might be a problem.
Had you said, co-dependent or self-destructive...
- Do you want a date, Saturday? - Yes, please.
Okay.
He is cute, he's funny,-
- He's a "he"? - Well, yeah.
Oh, God.
I just...I thought..
...you're not, so. Good, Shelly. Okay.
I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now.
Okay. Bye-bye.
(Chandler) It's hard to enjoy cup of ramen noodles after that.
I mean, is that ridiculous?
Can you believe she actually thought that?
Um..
...yeah.
Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know
I thought maybe.. Possibly you might be.
- You did? - Yeah, but then.
But then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party
talking to my breasts
so then I figured maybe not.
Huh, did uh...any of the rest of you guys think that
when you first met me?
- I did. - Yeah, I think so, yeah.
- Not me. - No, no, me neither.
Although, uh, you know, back in college, Susan Salidor did.
You're kidding.
- Did you tell her I was... - No.
Well, it's just 'cause uh...
I kinda wanted to go out with her too
So I told her, actually
you were seeing Bernie Spellman
who also liked her, so..
Well, this is fascinating.
So, uh, what is it about me?
I don't know.
'cause you're smart, you're funny--
Ross is smart and funny. You ever think that about him?
Yeah! Right!
What is it?
[laughing]
Okay, I-I don't know.
You-you just...you have a quality.
- Yes, right. - Exactly.
Yeah, a quality.
Oh, oh, a quality, good.
Because I was worried you guys were gonna be
vague about this.

Joey, what's going on?
Okay, listen, you gotta promise

Well, he didn't tell me.
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross' thing.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.

(Rachel) 'Okay, come on, somebody, somebody.'
(Monica) 'Alright, I'll go, I'll go.
Okay, um, senior year of college on a pool table.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo! - Pool table!
That's my sister.
Okay, okay.
My weirdest place would have to be..
...the women's room on the second floor
of the New York City public library.
Oh, my God.
What were you doing in a library?
Hey, Pheebs, what about you?
Oh, um, Milwaukee.
Uh, Ross?
[clears throat] Disneyland, 1989..
"It's a small world after all."
No way.
Yeah, the, uh, the ride broke down
so Carol and I went behind a couple of those
mechanical Dutch children.
Then they fixed the ride
and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Ooh, Rachel?
Oh, come on, I already went.
- 'No.' - You did not go!
- Yes, I did. - 'Come on tell us!'
- Come on. - Come on.
Alright, uh..
...the weirdest place would have to be..
...the foot of the bed.
- Step back. - We have a winner!
I've just never... had a relationship
with that kind of passion y'know?
Where-where you have to have somebody
right there, in the middle of a themepark.
Well, it was the only thing to do there
that didn't have a line.
Alright, well, see, I mean... Barry wouldn't even kiss me
on a miniature-golf course.
- Come on. - No.
He said we were "holding up the people behind us."
And you didn't marry him, because?
I mean, do you think..
...there are people that go through life
never having that kind of ...?
- Probably. - Really?
Well, you know, I'll tell you something.
Passion is way overrated.
- Yeah, right. - It is.
Uh, eventually, it kind of burns out.
But hopefully, what you're left with is trust..
and security and, uh..
...well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism.
So, you know, for all those people who miss out
on that, uh, passion thing.
...there's all that other good stuff.
[sighs] Okay.
But, um, but I don't think that's gonna be you.
- You don't? - Mm.
See, I see, uh..
...big passion in your future.
- Really? - Hmm.
- You do? - I do.
Oh, Ross, you're so great.
It's never gonna happen.
- What? - You and Rachel.
[chuckles]
[mumbling]
Why not?
Because you waited too long to make your move.
and now you're in the "friend zone".
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
No, Ross. You're mayor of the zone!
Look, I'm taking my time, alright?
I'm-I'm-I'm laying the groundwork.
Yeah, I mean, every day
just a little bit closer to, uh--
Priesthood!
Ross, I'm telling you, she no idea, what you're thinking
And if you don't ask her out soon..
...you're gonna end up stuck in the zone forever.
I will, I will. I'm jus.
See, I'm waiting for the, uh, the right moment.
[sighs]
What?
- What, now? - Yeah.
What's messing you up? The wine?
The candles? The moonlight? Huh?
You just gotta go up tor and you gotta say
- "Look, Rachel, I think- " - Shh-shh.
- Shh-shh. - What are we shushing?
We're shushing...because trying to-to hear something.
- What? What? - Uh, don't you hear that?
Ah.

Look at it this way. You dumped her!
Right? I mean, this-this woman was unbelievably sexy
and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable...
Tell me why you did this again.
- 'Hey!' - 'Hey!'
Movie star!
Hey. Wait, a minute.
Aren't you the guy who plays the butt
in the new Al Pacino movie?
Nope.
No? What happened, big guy?
'Big guy'?
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
- I got fired! - Oh!
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it.
I told everybody about this.
Now everyone's gonna go to the theatre expecting to see me and-
Joey, you know what? No one is gonna be able to tell.
My mom will.
Something so sweet and..
...disturbing about that.
You know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years..
and I finally get my shot...and I blow it!
Wait a minute. Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Yeah. I-I think when it's your shot
you know, you-you know it's your shot.
Did...did it feel like your shot?
Hard to tell. I was naked.
You know, I don't think this was your shot.
I mean, I don't even think you just get 'one' shot.
I really believe big things are gonna happen for you.
I do!
And you've gotta just keep thinking about
the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go...
"I got the part! I got the part!"
"I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!"
You think? That's so nice.
- Aw, come on. - Come here.
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
- Good night. - Good night, Monica.
Uh, Mon, you, you're goa leave your shoes out here?
Uh-huh.
Really? Just-just casually strewn about
in that reckless, haphazard manner?
Doesn't matter. I'll get them tomorrow. Or- not!
Whenever.
She is a kook.

Ta-da!
Are we greeting each other this way now
because I like that.
Look. I cleaned!
I did the windows. I did the floors!
I even used all those attachments on the vacuum
except for that little round one with the bristles
I don't know what that's for.
Ah, yeah. Nobody knows.
And we're not supposed to ask.
Well, what do you think?
- Very clean. - It's great!
- Really, it looks great. - Very clean.
Oh, I see you moved the green ottoman.
(together) Uh-oh.
H-how did that happen?
I don't know. I-I thougt it looked better there.
And I.. Also it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
Yeah, it's-it's interesting.
But you know what? Just for fun.
Let's see what it looked like in the old spot.
Just to compare. Let's see...
Ha. Well, it looks good there too.
Let's just leave it there for a while.
Can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines.
I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
Guys, I am not that bad.
Yeah, you are, Monica.
Remember when I lived with you?
You were like a little, you know..
[mimicking Psycho theme]
That is so unfair.
Oh, come on. When we were kids
yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll
that wasn't raggedy.
Okay, so I'm responsible. I'm organized.
But, hey, I can be a kook.
Oh.
Alright, you madcap gal.
Try to imagine this.
The phone bill arrives
but you don't pay it right away.
Why not?
Because you're a 'kook'.
Instead, you wait until they send you a notice.
I could do that.
Okay, okay, then you let me go grocery shopping
and I buy laundry detergent
but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Why would someone do that?
One might wonder.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table
There's no coaster. It's cold drink, it's a hot day.
Little beads of condensation are inching
their way closer and closer to the surface of the world.
Stop it!
Oh, my God.
It's true. Who am I?
Monica, you're mom.
[gasps]
[mimicking Psycho theme]
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
'Oh, my God!'
Okay!
Okay, I'll be there.
That was my agent.
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!
- What? - You're kidding!
- What's the part? - Can you believe this?
Al Pacino!
This guy's the reason I became an actor.
POOP
[imitating Al Pacino] "I'm out of order? Pha."
"You're out of order!"
"This whole courtroom's out of order!"
Seriously, what-what's the part?
"Just when I thought I was out"
"they pull me back in."
Come on, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
Uh..
[mumbling]
You're..
[mumbling] ...what?
I'm his butt double, ok?
I play Al Pacino's butt.
Alright? He goes into the showe.
and then I'm his butt.
- Oh, my God. - Come on, you guys.
This is a real movie
and Al Pacino's in it and that's big.
Oh, no, it's terrific, it's, it's..
You know, you deserve it, after all your years
of struggling you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.
Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care.
This is a big break for me.
No, you're right, you're right, it is.
So, you gonna invite us all to the big opening?

Coming through. Move. Move!
Oh, excuse-excuse me.
I was kind of using that machine.
Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.
But I-I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that your basket?
- Yes. Yeah. - It's really pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
What?
No suds, no save, okay?
- What's going on? - Hi, um, nothing.
This horrible woman just took my machine.
Was your basket on top?
- Yeah, but there were no suds. - So?
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
No suds, no.. Excuse me.
Hold on a second.
This is my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Alright. Show's over.
Nothing to see here.
Okay. Let's do laundry.
- That was amazing. - Well..
I can't even send back soup.
Well, that's-that's because...
you're such a sweet, gentle, uh..
Um, uh, do you, uh..
Do you-oh! hey, you must need detergent.
Oh!
- What's that? - "Überweiss."
It's, uh, it's new. It's German.
It's extra tough.
Rach, do you, uh.. Are you gonna separate those?
Oh, God. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spazz?
I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts...
and another machine for pants?
Have you, have you never done this before?
Well, not myself but I w other people that have.
Okay. You caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Uh, well, don't worry. I'll use the gentle cycle.
Okay, um..
Uh, basically, you wanna use one machine for all your whites.
- Whites. - Okay?
A whole other machine for-for your colors.
And-and a third for, uh, your, uh ... ha!
uh... delicates.
and that would be your bras and your... underpant-y things.
Okay, well, what about.. These are white cotton panties.
Would they go with whites or with delicates?
Uh, that-that.. That would be a judgment call.

So, Saturday night, the big night.
Date night, Saturday night.
Sa-tur-day night.
- No plans, huh? - Not a one.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Oh, right, right. Shut up.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone.
- 'You just gotta do it' - No, I know.
But it's just so hard, y'know?
I mean, you're sitting there with her.
She has no idea what's happening.
And then you finally get up the courage to do it
and there's that horrible awkward moment
when you've handed her the note and..
Uh, why do you have to break up with her?
Be a man. Just stop callin'.
You know, if-if you want, I'll do it with you.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like
we're ganging up on her.
No, I mean, you break up with Janice.
- And I'll break up with Tony. - 'Tony?'
- You're breaking up with Tony? - Yeah.
I know he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore.
You know, I don't know if it's me or his hunger strike
or I don't know.
Does anybody want anything else?
Oh, yeah, last week, you had a wonderful nutty
chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing that..
Nothing. Just-just.. I'm fine.
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Oh, it's my father.
He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
That guy, he burns me up.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home.
- Oh! - Ugh, it was horrible.
He called me young lady.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Did he give you that whole
"You're not up to this " again?
Oh, yeah, yeah, actually I got
the extended disco version with three choruses
of "You'll never make it on your own."
♪ Uh-huh uh-huh ♪
Hi, Joey.
- Oh, my God. Angela. - Wow.
Being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
- Are you gonna go over? - No.
Yeah. No.

[instrumental music]
Excuse me.
It says to call this number
if you're not completely satisfied
with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency.
Well, I guess you'd know that
or we'd be in the predicament room.
[Chandler chuckles]
Hold on.
Fill these out. Sit over there.
Look, look, look, I don't want to make any trouble, okay?
But I'm in a lot of pain here, alright?
My face is dented.
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Any minute now.
[scoffs]
Hey, miss..
Hey..
(Ross) I remember the moonlight
coming in through the open window
and her face had the most incredible glow.
Yes, the moon, the glow
the magical feeling, you did this part.
Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
He's right. Enough already.
What is the big deal about today?
So you slept with her for the first time. So what?
You slept with her for seven years after that.
Look, it's just a little more complicated.
Well, what? What? What is it?
That she left you, that she likes women
that she left you for another woman that likes women?
A little louder, okay?
I think, there's a man
on the 12th floor in a coma
who didn't quite hear you.
Then what?
My first time with Carol was..
[whispering] It was my first time.
What?
It was my first...time.
With Carol?
Oh.
So in your whole life
you've only been with one...oh.
Whoa, boy, hockey was a big mistake.
There's a whole bunch of stuff we could have done tonight.
Man, can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
I think it's great.
You know, it's sweet, it's romantic..
- Really? - Nah. You kiddin'?
The guy's a freak. I judge him.
- Hey! - 'Hey, buddy!'
Huh? Huh?
Oh...that's attractive.
Oh, I thought you were great in "Silence of the Lambs."
Oh, come on, admit it!
All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Fun? Where was the fun?
Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part?
Where's my puck?
Oh, ah, the kid has it.
The kid..
[clears throat] Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
You gotta do it, man.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever..
Can't do it.
Listen, uh, gimme back my puck.
No.
- Yes, how about-- - No.
- Come here. Gimme! - No. No.

Oh!
Now that was fun.

(Joey) ...95, 96, 97.
See, I told you.
Less than a hundred steps
from our place to here.
You got way too much free time.
Hey, there's the birthday boy.
Ross, check it out.
Hockey tickets, Rangers Penguins
tonight at the Garden and we're taking you.
Happy birthday, pal.
We love you, man.
[chuckles]
That's funny. My birthday was seven months ago.
So?
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket
and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date, huh?
Well, aren't we Mr. The-glass-is-half-empty?
Oh, my God. Oh.
Is today the 20th, October 20th?
I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
[groans]
What's wrong with the 20th?
Eleven days before Halloween..
...all the good costumes are gone?
Today's the day Carol and I first..
...consummated our..
...physical relationship.
With sex.
You know what? I'd better pass on the game.
I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife
and her lesbian lover.
To hell with hockey. Let's all do that.
Come on, Ross. You, me, Joey
ice, guys night out.
Come on. What do you say, big guy?
Huh? Huh? Huh?
- What are you doin'? - I have no idea.
Come on, Ross.
Alright. Alright. Maybe it will take my mind off it.
You promise to buy me a big foam finger?
- You got it. - Alright.
Look. Look. Look. My first paycheck.
[cheering]
Look at the window.
There's my name! Hi, me!
I remember the day I got my first paycheck.
There was a cave-in in one of the mines.
And eight people were killed.
Wow. You worked in a mine?
I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?
God! Isn't this exciting? I earned this.
I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk for it.
And it was totally..
...not worth it.
Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money?
I mean, what?
Chandler, look at that.
Oh. This is not that bad.
Oh. You're fine, yeah, for a first job.
You can totally, totally live on this.
(Monica) 'Oh, yeah. Yeah.'
Hey, by the way, great service today.
- Oh! - Yeah!
Terrific.

- And lamb chop.. - 'Ooh, lamb chop.'
How old is that sock?
If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years
it'd be talking too.
Okay, I think it's time to change
somebody's nicotine patch.
Hey! Where's Joey?
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him.
Do you think that was wrong?
I think he's across the hall.
Thanks.
There you go.

Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Hey, I might.
Sorry.
You know, those stupid soda people gave me
seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
- Oh, my God! - Seven thousand dollars?
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum.
What is up with the universe?
- What's goin' on? - Nothing.
I just think it's nice when
we're all here together.
Even nicer when everyone gets
to wear their underwear.
- Uh, Joey. - Oh, God!
Okay.
- Oh, come on. - That was lamb chop!
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a Deja Vu.
No, I'm not.
Alright, we have to talk.
There it is!
Okay. It's, it's about Alan.
There's something that you should know.
[sighs] Oh, man, there's really no easy way to say this, uh.
I've decided to break up with Alan.
[all sighs]
Is there somebody else?
No, no, no. It's just..
You know, things change.
People change.
We didn't change.
So that's it? It's over?
Just like that?
You know, you let your guard down.
You know, you start to really care about someone.
And I just.. I..
Look, I, I could go on pretending--
- Okay. - 'No!'
But that wouldn't be fair to me. It wouldn't be fair to Alan.
- It wouldn't be fair to you. - Yeah, well, who wants fair?
I mean, I just want things back. You know, the way they were.
- I'm sorry. - Oh, she's sorry!
I feel better.
I just can't believe this.
I mean, with the holidays coming up..
...I wanted him to meet my family.
I'll meet someone else.
There'll be other Alans.
- No! - Oh, yeah, right.
- Are you guys gonna be okay? - Hey, hey, we'll be fine.
We're just gonna need a little time.
I understand.
[sighs] Wow!
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.
But, I gotta tell you, I'm a little relieved.
Relieved?
Yeah, well, I mean
I had a great time with you.
I just can't stand your friends.

No, no, no.
They say it's the same as the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb
the the tip of his index finger.
That's ridiculous.
Can I use either thumb?
Alright. Don't tell me. Don't tell me.
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.
Coffee, black.
Latte.
And an iced tea.
I'm getting pretty good at this.
- Excellent. - Good job.
Good for me.
[mumbling]
- You okay, Phoebe? - Yeah. No, I'm just, it's, uh..
It's not even worth. It's my bank.
And what did they do to you?
It's not, it's just.. Okay.
I'm goin' through my mail, and I open
up their monthly, you know, statement--
- Easy, easy. - And, yeah..
And there's $500 extra in my account.
Oh! Satan's minions at work again.
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there and deal with them.
What are you talkin' about? Keep it.
It's not mine. I didn't earned it.
If I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping.
Okay. Okay.
Let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes.
Do you know what I'd hear with every step I took?
Not mine. Not mine. Not mine.
And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping.
I'd hear, not-not mine. Not-not mine.
We're with you. We got it
Okay. I just, I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It would be like this giant karmic debt.
(Monica) 'Chandler, what are you doin'?'
Hey, what are you doing?
- Oh, whoa! - Oh, gross.
- What are you doing? - What is this?
I'm smoking. I'm smoking I'm smoking.
Oh, I can't believe you.
You've been so good for three years.
And this...is my reward.
Hold on a second, alright.
Just think about what you went
through the last time you quit.
Okay, so this time I won't quit.
- No! Put it down. - Alright! I'm putting it out.
I'm putting it out.
Oh, no! I, uh.. I can't drink this now.
Alright, I'm gonna go change. I've got a date.
Is this Alan again? How's it goin'?
It's going pretty good, you know.
It's nice and we're having fun.
So, when do we get to meet the guy?
- 'Yeah?' - Let's see, today's Monday.
- Never. - Come on!
No, no, not after what happened with Steve.
What are you talking about? We love Steve.
Steve was sexy!
- Sorry. - Yeah.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet.
Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Well, then can we meet him?
No. Sorry.

Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them
any more ammunition than they already have.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about
the flatness of a child's pillow.
Monica, hi! Um..
Monica, you're scaring me.
I mean, you're like, you're all chaotic and twirly, you know.
And not-not in a good way.
Yeah, calm down.
You don't see Ross getting all chaotic
and twirly every time they come.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned
Ross can do no wrong.
You see, he's the prince.
Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
- Ew, ew, ew! - What?
Ugly naked guy got a Thighmaster.
(in unison) Ew!
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
No-no, don't touch that.
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough
having to give it back to him..
Hi, Barry! Remember me?
I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart
in front of your entire family!
Oh, God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring
without the ring, which makes it so much harder.
Easy, Rach, we'll find it.
- Won't we? - Oh, yeah.
Alright, when did you have it on last?
Doy! Probably right before she lost it.
You don't get a lot of doy these days.
I know, I had it this morning
and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with..
Dinah?
Oh, don't be mad.
- You didn't. - Oh, I'm sorry.
I gave you one job!
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are.
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.
I just can't do it.
Boys? We're going in.
[knock on door]
Hi.
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Carol's pregnant.
Ooh! I found it!
W-w-what?
Yeah.
Do that for another two hours
you might be where I am right about now.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Well now, how how do you fit into this whole thing?
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved
but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.
Basically it's totally up to me.
She is so great! I miss her.
Well, what does she mean by involved?
I mean, presumably the biggest part of your job is done.
Anyway, they want me to go down to this
sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
- Wow. - So what are you gonna do?
I have no idea.
No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
[cutlery clanking]
Well, this is still ruined, right?

["Star spangled banner" instrumental]
Well, that's it.
- You gonna crash on the couch? - No.
No, I gotta go home, sometime.
Alright. You gonna be okay?
- Yeah. - Goodnight.
Hey, Mon, look what I just found on the floor.
[chuckles]
What?
That's Paul's watch.
Now, you just, put it back where you found it.
Oh, boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.
[thud]
[chuckling]
- Hmm. - 'Hmm.'
- Hmm. Oh, no. - Oh, sorry.
- Oh, no, no. Go. Go-go. - No, have it, really.
- I don't want. - Split it?
- Okay. - Okay.
[chuckles]
Thanks.
You probably didn't know this but back in high school
I had a..
...major crush on you.
I knew.
You did? Oh.
[scoffs]
I always figured you just thought
I was Monica's geeky older brother.
- I did. - Oh.
Listen, do you think
and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here
but you think it would be okay
if I asked you out sometime maybe?
Yeah.
Maybe.
Okay.
Okay, maybe I will.
[laughing]
- Alright. Goodnight. - Goodnight.
[door opens and closes]
See ya.
Mm-hmm.
Wait, wait.
Hey, what's with you?
I just grabbed a spoon.

[Friends: Rachel Runs Out on her Wedding to Barry (Season 1 Clip) | TBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v14PWuURC7Y&list=PLJBo3iyb1U0cGfTm1du_L8b81kiGioqJ7&index=165)   

Hi.
This guy says, "Hello," I want to kill myself.
You okay, sweetie?
I just feel like someone reached down my throat
grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth
and tied it around my neck.
Cookie?
Carol moved her stuff out today.
(all) Ohh.
- Let me get you some coffee. - Thanks.
Oh, ugh.
Uh-oh, no. No, don't. Stop cleansing my aura.
Don't. Just leave my aura alone, okay?
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone
I hope she'll be very happy.
- No, you don't - No, I don't.
To hell with her, she left me!
And you never knew she was a lesbian.
No, okay?
Why does everyone keep fixating on that?
She didn't know, how should I know?
Sometimes, I wish I was a lesbian.
Did I say that out loud?
Alright, Ross, look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.
You're angry. You're hurting.
Can I tell you what the answer is?
Strip joints!
Come on, you're single. Have some hormones..
But I don't want to be single, okay?
I just, I just, I just want to be married again.
And I just won a million dollars.
Rachel?
[gasps] Oh, God, Monica, hi. Thank god.
I just went to your building and you weren't there.
And then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here
and you are. You are.
Can I get you some coffee?
Decaf.
Okay, everybody this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.
This-this is everybody.
This is Chandler, and Phoebe
and Joey.
And you remember my brother, Ross?
- Sure! Hi. - Hey.
So you want to tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?
Oh, God! Well..
...it started about a half-hour before the wedding.
I was in this room where we were keeping all the presents
And I was looking at this gravy boat.
This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
When all of sudden.. Sweet N' Low?
I realized
I realized that I was more turned on
by this gravy boat than by Barry.
And then I got really freaked out.
And that's when it hit me
how much Barry looks Mr. Potato Head.
You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but..
Anyway, I just had to get out of there
and I started wondering "Why am I doing this?"
and "Who am I doing this for?"
So, anyway, I just didn't know where to go
and I know that you and I have kind of drifted apart
but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Oh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.
