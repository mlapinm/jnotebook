As a break of dawn came closer
AII my hopes seemed so forlorn
The misty signs of laughter
And the light eluded all
And my despair was caught in motion
A face just barely true
Shadows in blue
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
In the changing of the season
Releasing one lost name
And the scar once healed forever
Dissolving in the rain
A twig snapped in the clearing
A glimpse of golden skin
My face within
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
And my despair was caught in motion
A face just barely true
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
As a break of dawn came closer
AII my hopes seemed so forlorn
The misty signs of laughter
And the light eluded all
And my despair was caught in motion
A face just barely true
Shadows in blue
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
In the changing of the season
Releasing one lost name
And the scar once healed forever
Dissolving in the rain
A twig snapped in the clearing
A glimpse of golden skin
My face within
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
And my despair was caught in motion
A face just barely true
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night
A flash in the night

Casablanсa (оригинал Jessica Jay)
I fell in love with you watching Casablanca.
Back row of the drive in show
In the flickerin' light.
Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars
Became champange and caviar.
Makin' love on a long hot summer night.

I thought you fell in love
With me watching Casablanca
Holdin' hands 'neath the paddle fans,
In Rick's candle lit cafe

Hidin' the shadows from the spies.
Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
Makin' magic at the movies
In my own Cheverolet

Oh! A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca.
But a kiss is not a kiss
Without your sigh.
Please come back to me in Casablanca.
I love you more and more each day as time goes by.

I guess there are many broken hearts in Casablanca.
You know l've never really been there so l don't know.
I guess our love story will never be seen
On the big white silver screen.
But it hurts just as bad
When I had to watch you go.

My Bed Is Too Big (оригинал Blue System)
I don't call it love
Come take me in your heart
Oh, I can't get enough
I know we will never part
We are nightbirds my baby
Nightbirds will never stop
Oh, you're playing with fire
Lost in my desire
Baby, you're so hot

My bed is too big

Too big without you, baby
I wanna have your body
Come gimme what you've got
My bed is too big
Too big without you, lady
I wanna have no heartache
Come hit me with your shot

In a world of stone
Love'll never been the same
I hate to be alone - tired of playing games
You like coctails at midnight
Diamonds and silver a lot
You're a woman behind me
Oh, set my heart free
Baby, you're so hot

My bed is too big
Too big without you, baby
I wanna have your body
Come gimme what you've got
My bed is too big
Too big without you, lady
I wanna have no heartache
Come hit me with your shot

You can travel around the world
You can have all kinds of girls
But you never gonna find a one
To love you like I do
You can try to walk away
And your heart can go astray
But you'll come back to me
You knew it at the stars
(Flash-baby, flash-maybe)
REFRAIN:
Flash - in the night
Let me feel your body melt in mine
Heartflash tonight
Whisper "Ti amo" all through the night
Flash in the night
Never knew your touch can be so nice
Wanna heartflash tonight
I can't resist your charm
Turn me on
Now I'll understand
That you're not a one-lady-man
My friends said: "Beware!"
But you know I don't care
Flash, flash
In the edge we always knew
It's gonna be me and you
Don't turn away
Baby hear what I say
(Flash-baby, Flash-maybe)
Flash - in the night
Let me feel your body melt in mine
Heartflash tonight
Whisper "Ti amo" all through the night
Flash in the night
Never knew your touch can be so nice
Wanna heartflash tonight
I can't resist your charm
Turn me on
Flash - in the night
Let me feel your body melt in mine
Heartflash tonight
Whisper "Ti amo" all through the night
Flash in the night
Never knew your touch can be so nice
Wanna heartflash tonight
I can't resist your charm, flash

Stop that crying
Stop that lying
It's boring me
I don't wanna spend my time with you
Stop to think
That once you brought me to exctasy
I want the loving that I really need
RAP:
Stop, you breathe you lie
Loops got ya lost I can't hear ya
Treason took a try
Desperate drown in dirty things
Juvenile Jazz you hide
Can't loose no love from day I shared
Faint twinkle in your eyes
Weary from how you earn your things
You slip from sliding
Slowly, slither, sneaky
Simple for a snake
Poser in pursuit of passion
Can't rush my quiver fake a quake
Betrayer, disarrayer,
Leave a soft one frying in the pain
Deceitful, full of that
Couldn't care less if you're crying in the rain
CHORUS:
Stop that crying
Stop that lying
It's boring me
I don't wanna spend my time with you
Stop to think
That once you brought me to exctasy
I want the loving that I really need
Wooh, oh, hoh
Stop that crying in the rain now
No more crying in the rain
Who said that crying in the rain
Could ever wash away a lover's pain
Wooh, oh, hoh
Stop that crying in the rain now
No more crying in the rain
Who said that crying in the rain
Could ever wash away a lover's pain
Wooh, oh, hoh

Refrain:
Feel the heat of the night
everything's allright
Feel the power of my heart
give me all your love
all you need is feel right now
all you need is feel right now
all you need is feel right now
all you need is feel my love
Rap 1
Jumpin', jumpin' up and down
from the top right to the ground
free your soul and free your mind.
Now set you free, right on time
it's weekend and it's party-time
feel the heat and free your mind
put your hands up in the air
and wave 'em like you just don't care
Feel the rhythm stay real tight
feel the heat feel the night
let the groove control your move
shake your bud and make me hot
party-people, party-dance
shake your body wave your hands
you know how to do it right
feel the heat of the night.
Rap 2
Pumpin', stompin', people jumpin'
people dancing everywhere
the DJ's playing music loud
so wave your hands up in the air
Move your body shake your bud
the rhythm of the music's so hot
I see you do your turnaround
on the dancefloor up and down.
Party, party, people party
party people, party dance
come on people move your body
shake your body wave your hands
Sweat is dropping down all over my face
I feel your sex right in this place
you got to get this rhythm right
and feel the heat of the night
