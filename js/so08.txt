It's My Life (оригинал Dr. Alban)
It's my life take it or leave it
Set me free what's that crap papa-know-it-all
I got my own life you got your own life
Live your life and set me free
Mind your business and leave my business
You know everything papa-know-it-all
Very little knowledge is dangerous
Stop bugging me stop bothering me
Stop bugging me stop forcing me
Stop fighting me stop yelling me
It's my life


[Chorus:]
It's my life it's my life my worries
It's my life it's my life my problems
It's my life it's my life my worries
It's my life it's my life my problems

It's my life do you understand
I live the way I want to live
I make decisions day and night
Show me signs and good examples
Stop telling me how to run your business
Take a trip to east and west
You find that you don't know anything
Every's getting tired of you
Sometimes you have to look and listen
You can even learn from me
Little knowledge is dangerous
It's my life

[Chorus:]
It's my life it's my life my worries
It's my life it's my life my problems
It's my life it's my life my worries
It's my life it's my life my problems

It's my life set me free
So you're bad so you lie
What you see is what you get
Listen to people are...
Things I do I do that no more
Things I say I say that no more
Changes come once in life
Stop bugging me stop bothering me
Stop bugging me stop forcing me
Stop fighting me stop yelling me
Stop telling me stop seeing me
It's my life

[Chorus:]
It's my life it's my life my worries
It's my life it's my life my problems
It's my life it's my life my worries
It's my life it's my life my problems

Chorando se foi quem un dia so me fez chorar
Chorando se foi quem un dia so me fez chorar
Chorando estara ao lembrar de un amor
Que un dia nao soube cuidar
Chorando estara ao lembrar de un amor
Que un dia nao soube cuidar

A recordacao vai estar com ele aonde for
A recordacao vai estar pre siempre aonde su for
Danca sol e mar quardarei no othar
O amor faz perder encontrar

Lambando estarei ao lembrar que este amor
Por un dia un instante foi rei

A recordacao vai estar com ele aonde for
A recordacao vai estar pre siempre aonde su for
Chorando estara ao lembrar de un amor
Que un dia nao soube cuidar
Cancao riso e dor melodia de amor
Un momento que tica no mar
I-I-I
Losenta Lambada


Lambada
Chorando se foi quem un dia so me fez chorar
Chorando se foi quem un dia so me fez chorar
Chorando estara ao lembrar de un amor
Que un dia nao soube cuidar
Chorando estara ao lembrar de un amor
Que un dia nao soube cuidar

A recordacao vai estar com ele aonde for
A recordacao vai estar pre siempre aonde su for
Danca sol e mar quardarei no othar
O amor faz perder encontrar
Lambando estarei ao lembrar que este amor
Por un dia un instante foi rei

A recordacao vai estar com ele aonde for
A recordacao vai estar pre siempre aonde su for
Chorando estara ao lembrar de un amor
Que un dia nao soube cuidar
Cancao riso e dor melodia de amor
Un momento que tica no mar

Take your chance
Bring your life up to the top
And you never ever stop
And you try to do it right
You better take your chance
And luck will always be around
Keep your feet down on the ground
And you will never be alone
Come on come on take your chance
Your life is very hard
No time for romance
You know that life is hard
But you know that you'll make it
There is only one chance in life
And you better take it
You got some hard time
You got some bad time
You got some ruff time and you got some sad times
Listen to the word from the man smooth t.
We all get bizzy with da fun factory
Once you're the winner
But then you lose the game
Don't try to hide your sadness
'Cause we all feel the same
Praying to god and I hope he's going to save me
'Cause when he's around
Источник teksty-pesenok.ru
I feel a special kind of safety
Take it take it just don't fake it
Put me in the spot and i won't fake it
Take your chance
Common take your chance
Ringidingiding ringidingidingdong
Me feel so sad ya'll
Me feel so sad ya'll
Can't control the beat of my heart ya'll
Me felt so sad when i left my family
Broken heart sad eyes low mentality
You better watch me
You better watch me
When i come to you
Nobody can stop me
Listen to the words from the man Smooth T
We all get busy with da Fun Factory
Take a look over troubled waters
Think about today what's up for tomorrow
What you really want is a chance to be free
How you're livin' what's about 'g'
Take a look in a looking glass
In a life class
Just watch me blass
That microphone is right straight to your heart

Ma Baker (оригинал Boney-M)
Freeze! I'm Ma baker - put your hands in the air,
Gimme all your money

This is the story of Ma baker, the meanest cat
From ol' Chicago town
She was the meanest cat
In old Chicago town
She was really moved them down
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all
She was the meanest cat

Oh she was realy tough
She left her husband flat
He wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along
'Cause they were mean and strong

Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die

They left a trail of crime
Across the U.S.A
And when one boy was killed
She realy made them pay
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all

She met a man she liked
She thought she'd stay with him
One day he formed with them
They did away with him
She didn't care at all
Just didn't care at all

Oh-oh-oh-oh, tonight (4x)
Tonight why have you changed my life this way?
Why can't you just come back and stay?
Since you're gone I miss you so
I was a fool to let you go
'Cause you took my breath away this time
CHORUS:
Tonight I'm walking in the rain
Источник teksty-pesenok.ru
I know that it's a shame
I cannot stand tears in my eyes
Oh tonight
I know I saw your face that night
And something in your eyes can't hide
That you're still in love with me
Or is it just my destiny
One more time to stay alone again?
chorus

New York City Boy (Pet Shop Boys)
When you're a boy
some days are tough
lying on your bed
playing punk rock and stuff
Home is a boot camp
you gotta escape
Wanna go and wander
in the ticker-tape
You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run

into New York City

New York City boy
you'll never have a bored day
'cause you're a New York City boy
where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

The street is amazing
the hoochies unreal
Check out all the hardware
at the latest deal
Hear a song
That's the bomb!
If you don't get that mix
it's gone eighty-six
You feel the deal is real
You're in New York City

New York City Boy
you'll never have a bored day
'cause you're a New York City boy
where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
New York City boy
This is your reward day
'cause you're a New York City boy
where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

Then when the evening falls
you can return its calls

You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run
into New York City
