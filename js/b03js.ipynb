    "#### The onFulfilled and onRejected Functions\n",
    "To handle a “successful” promise, or a promise that resolved, we invoke .then() on the promise, passing in a success handler callback function:\n",

    "We invoke prom‘s .then() function passing in our handleSuccess() function.\n",
    "Since prom resolves, handleSuccess() is invoked with prom‘s resolved value, 'Yay', so 'Yay' is logged to the console.\n",
    "With typical promise consumption, we won’t know whether a promise will resolve or reject, so we’ll need to provide the logic for either case. We can pass both an onFulfilled and onRejected callback to .then().\n",

    "#### Using catch() with Promises\n",
    "One way to write cleaner code is to follow a principle called separation of concerns. Separation of concerns means organizing code into distinct sections each handling a specific task. It enables us to quickly navigate our code and know where to look if something isn’t working.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, .then() will return a promise with the same settled value as the promise it was called on if no appropriate handler was provided. This implementation allows us to separate our resolved logic from our rejected logic. Instead of passing both handlers into one .then(), we can chain a second .then() with a failure handler to a first .then() with a success handler and both cases will be handled.\n",

    "    console.log(rejectionReason);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "Since JavaScript doesn’t mind whitespace, we follow a common convention of putting each part of this chain on a new line to make it easier to read. To create even more readable code, we can use a different promise function: .catch().\n",
    "\n",
    "The .catch() function takes only one argument, onRejected. In the case of a rejected promise, this failure handler will be invoked with the reason for rejection. Using .catch() accomplishes the same thing as using a .then() with only a failure handler.\n",

    "We use another .then() to print the second promise’s resolved value to the console.\n",

    "#### Handling Independent Promises\n",
    "Remember that await halts the execution of our async function. This allows us to conveniently write synchronous-style code to handle dependent promises. But what if our async function contains multiple promises which are not dependent on the results of one another to execute?\n",

    "In our concurrent() function, both promises are constructed without using await. We then await each of their resolutions to print them to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our concurrent() function both promises’ asynchronous operations can be run simultaneously. If possible, we want to get started on each asynchronous operation as soon as possible! Within our async functions we should still take advantage of concurrency, the ability to perform asynchronous actions at the same time.\n",

    "Another way to take advantage of concurrency when we have multiple promises which can be executed simultaneously is to await a Promise.all().\n",
    "\n",
    "We can pass an array of promises as the argument to Promise.all(), and it will return a single promise. This promise will resolve when all of the promises in the argument array have resolved. This promise’s resolve value will be an array containing the resolved values of each promise from the argument array.\n",

Next, we loop through our resultArray, and log each item to the console. The first element in resultArray is the resolved value of the asyncTask1() promise, the second is the value of the asyncTask2() promise, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promise.all() allows us to take advantage of asynchronicity— each of the four asynchronous tasks can process concurrently. Promise.all() also has the benefit of failing fast, meaning it won’t wait for the rest of the asynchronous actions to complete once any one has rejected. As soon as the first promise in the array rejects, the promise returned from Promise.all() will reject with that reason. As it was when working with native promises, Promise.all() is a good choice if multiple asynchronous tasks are all required, but none must wait for any other before executing.\n",
