Chorus:
More and more and more, I don't know where we're going to
More and more and more, there's so much we don't wanna do
'cause we lie, we cheat and we learn from each and every heart affair
yes, we lie, we cheat and we hurt till somebody's in despair
(rap)
Boom, keep in tune,
hollywood will soon left the point,
right to the point smokin'
like it's a joint, makin'
ain't got time to be fakin'
it's my turn and I'm takin'
everything without shakin'
yo here with the bacon

What a world, what a place to be
See the people everywhere
The pain of nations -
I tell you
Mother earth needs the help
Of all the children of the world
A revolution
Here we go -
Hear me say
It's revolution in paradise
Here we go -
Hear me say
It's revolution in paradise
What a world, what a place to be
So many people in misery
So much pain, so much poverty
We all should be free
See the beauty is everywhere
Mother earth, you must take more care
We all live in a paradise
We must treat her right
Here we go -
Hear me say
It's revolution in paradise
Here we go -
Hear me say
It's revolution in paradise

Brother Louie (оригинал Modern Talking)
Deep love is a burning fire
Stay, 'cause then the flames grow higher
Babe, don't let him steal your heart
It's easy, easy
Girl, this game can't last forever
Why, we cannot live together?
Try, don't let him take your love from me

You're no good, can't you see
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love - set you free

Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So, leave it Louie
'Cause I'm her lover

Stay, 'cause this boy wants to gamble
Stay, love is more than he can handle
Girl, come on, stay by me forever, ever
Why does he go on pretending
That his love is never ending
Babe, don't let him steal your love from me

You're no good, can't you see
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love - set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart

When I'm looking for somebody new
You're the clue.
Only change my mind
When I feel so blind
Then you make me see
Love is free.
Only you
When I look at your eyes in the blue
Love me too.

When your teardrops are lit by the moon
Laugh too soon.

When I feel so blind
Then you make me see
Love is free.

Don't push me aside (my love's alive)
Don't leave me to die (you will survive)
You hold me so tight (turn off the light)
It all seems so right...

Strangers by Night (оригинал C.C. Catch)
When you're down and feelin' blue
Close your eyes, I'll be with you,
Oh heartache, here comes heartache,
Makin' love for him was fun,
He never needed anyone,
Oh heartache, here comes heartache

[Chorus:]
Strangers by night
Be strangers tomorrow,
'cause deep in the night

The light is fooling your hearts,
And lovers tonight inside our hearts
Are lovers tomorrow,
But lovers by night
Sometimes be strangers today

Nights won't last forever, girl
Strange are the ways of this world,
Oh heartache, here comes heartache,
Cinderella, heroes wait,
For your hard times it's too late,
Oh heartache, here comes heartache

[Chorus]

Strangers tonight
Be strangers tomorrow,
Lady, tonight
Tonight be careful with love,
Some love is too hot, too hot to stop
A bad fall tomorrow,
And lovers by night
Sometimes be strangers today

And lovers by night
Sometimes be strangers today
