[Chorus:]
Ten o'clock postman
Bring me her letter
Ten o'clock postman
Make me feel better
Been so many days
Since that I've met her
Ten o'clock postman
Bring me her letter
Bring me her letter


I'm walking all over the room
Wonder why I don't stop biting my nails
Why carry this feeling of doom
A couple more hours and I'll get the mail
I'll get the mail

Finding it so hard to eat
The toast and the eggs they just don't taste the same
Hearing a noise in the street
I run to the window and cry out in vain

[Chorus]

Remembering that she said for sure
I'll write you the minute I'll get off the plane
Nothing, not one single word
It must come this morning or I'll go insane
I'll go insane

Now it's been almost five days
Could she have sent it by air or by rail
I hear someone's comin' this way
This must be it, yes it must be the mail

[Chorus]

Dance with Me (оригинал Dj Bobo)
I'm back again on a higher stage.
Listen to my party beat and get in rage
'Cause you know when I flow and I show you so
Which way is better, which way you got to go
To make a fun house party or noddy,
You gotta check this out, yo-la-da-di!
There's a party over there with glamours and glare,
So dance and move you - pump that body,
Move your body up and down,
Side to side, it is party time!
Yeah, that's right we're dancing tonight
'Till the sun is coming and the sky is bright,
Then we are coming to an end like you understand.
That I'm a party man did the best I can
To make you laugh again,
Now I'm out of the scene,
Ahahahah!
Another time, another place,
Another rhyme done for every race.
In your case we're getting rough,
I'm not going to stop until you get enough,
'Cause you groove back and forth, forth and back.
Then you see it yourself it's like a heart attack,
My rhymes are a combination, infiltration,
Situation all over the nation,
Like round and round, upside down!
Living my life 'till your feet are on the ground,
Then put your hands up in the air,
Wave them like you just don't care.
And if you are ready to rock, then rock with me!
Somebody say oh yeah, oh yeah!
Oh yeah, oh yeah!
Now it's just the time I think you are with it,
So make some room and space just to hit it,
Move, move that body!
Ba-didely didely di, yeah we make a party,
To the B to the O to the B to the O!
Wanna rock your body, wanna rock your soul,
But I never ever said - I do it better,
Just know the time - yes I'm clever.
The way you had expected, your heading for the end.
Right that was another story from the party man and his clan,
They will come again, show and improve you, it's not the end.
It's a jam session, my confession,
And truly hard yeah one obsession.
But the joke is over, you know what I mean,
The party is gone, I'm out of the scene...


Hunters of the Night
[Verse 1:]
You know you touch my heart,
You made me running hide,
I wanna feel your body by my side.
You walk the streets again,
You need a love and friend
To try to stop the burning
Deep inside.
Love comes, love grows,
But your heart knows...
Touch you, you look at me,

And the hurt shows.

[Chorus:]
Hunters of the night,
The look on everyone's face I see
Leaving me cold again in my heart, my memories.
Hunters of the night,
Another time I feel the need in me,
Reaching for you again,
Love is such a mystery.
Hunters of the night,
Hunters of the night!

[Verse 2:]
Wanna hold you close
But you just turn away,
Seems there's nothing left
That I can say.
The kind of love you need
Is just too hard to find,
You know, you can deceive
When you made up lies.
Love comes, love grows,
But your heart knows...
Touch you, you look at me,
And the hurt shows.

[Chorus:]
Hunters of the night,
The look on everyone's face I see
Leaving me cold again in my heart, my memories.
Hunters of the night,
Another time I feel the need in me,
Reaching for you again,
Love is such a mystery.
Hunters of the night,
Hunters of the night!

Pretty Young Girl
I know life is different to you,
First love can be frightening, that's true
But take me as your brother and your friend
And take me as your lover and your man

[Chorus:]
Pretty young girl on my mind,
How I wish you to be mine,
Girl, you're no child anymore,
Pretty young girl on my mind,
Don't you know, know I can't hide

Can't hide my feelings
You're my girl and you're sixteen

Don't know is it wrong, is it right?
Sweet girl, I want to love you tonight,
So take me as your brother and your friend,
But first of all I wanna be your man


All That She Wants (оригинал Ace of Base)
She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morning
Light and the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
O' what a morning
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you


All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby

All that she wants - all that she wants

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's a hunter you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever
It's a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants...


Touch by Touch (оригинал Joy)
When I feel the time is right
And you're staying by my side
And the love you give to me
Makes my heart beat
When my fantasies fly away
But my feelings make me stay
I see the fire in your eyes
It makes my heart beat.

Do it, we still do it night and day
You're my all time lover

Do it, we still do it in a way
Like there is no other
Touch by touch
You're my all time lover
Skin to skin
Come under my cover.

When my heart is full of love
It makes me a turtle dove
Love's a game that we play
Night and day
When our love is clear and bright
It's our way to see the light
There's a fire in our hearts
Night and day.

[2x:]
Do it, we still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we still do it in a way
Like there is no other
Touch by touch
You're my all time lover
Skin to skin
Come under my cover.

Do it, we still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we still do it in a way
Like there is no other
Touch by touch.


Russian Lullaby (оригинал E-Type)
[Speak Russian]
[Privet, menya zovut E-Type!
Na zdorovie!]

When the seas are rolling in,
When the stars are shining clear,
When the ghosts are howling near,
When we sing the Russian lullaby.

(in the night in the night)


Let's you and me together leave for higher ground
When you're all alone just listen to the sound

Lullaby,
We fall asleep when we hear...
Lullaby,
We fly away when we hear...
Lullaby,
We travel far when we hear...
Lullaby,
When we hear the Russian lullaby...

(In the night), when the seas are rolling in,
(In the night), when the stars are shining clear,
(In the night), when the ghosts are howling near,
(In the night), when we sing the Russian lullaby.

(in the night in the night)

When we are going through the night in search of light
Let's you and me enjoy the mach 5 speed of life

Lullaby,
We fall asleep when we hear...
Lullaby,
We fly away when we hear...
Lullaby,
We travel far when we hear...
Lullaby,
When we hear the Russian lullaby...
(In the night), when the seas are rolling in,
(In the night), when the stars are shining clear,
(In the night), when the ghosts are howling near,
(In the night), when we sing the Russian lullaby.
(In the night),
We fall asleep when we hear...
(In the night),
We fly away when we hear...
(In the night),
We travel far when we hear...
(In the night),
When we sing the Russian lullaby...
When the seas are rolling in
(In the night), when the stars are shining clear
(In the night), when the ghosts are howling near
(In the night), when we sing the Russian lullaby
When we sing the Russian lullaby,
When we sing the Russian lullaby!

I Saw You Dancing 
I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da my love

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da

I'm waiting for a chance

To get to know you
To ask for a dance
Just look into my eyes
And I'll take you to paradise

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da my love

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da

I'm falling, I'm falling
Cause life's not easy for me

Please touch me like you do
To have you near me
To go where you go
Why waste a lot of time
My love is not a serious crime

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da my love

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da

I'm falling to pieces
Who do you think you are
Maybe I've gone too far
Maybe I'm in love with you
Don't hurt me or treat me bad
Cause I will fight for what is mine
Say Yaki-Da
Cause life is meant for living

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da my love

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da
