- Hey. - Hey.
- 'Where is everybody?' - They took Ben to the park.
Where have you been?
Just out.
Had some lunch, just me.
Little quality time with me.
Hey, thanks for your jacket.
Oh, it's no problem.
You can borrow it, by the way.
- Oh, here are your keys, hon. - 'Thank you.'
- Mon? - Hmm?
If, uh, you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53?
You know what probably happened?
Someone must have stolen my credit card.
And sort of just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Huh.
That is an excellent, excellent question.
That is excellent.
Monica, what's with you? Who did you have lunch with?
- Judy. - Who?
- Julie. - What?
Jody.
You were with Julie?
Look. When it started
I was just trying to be nice to her
because she was my brother's girlfriend.
And then, one thing led to another
and before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Oh!
Oh, my God.
Look. Honey, wait.
We only did it once.
It didn't mean anything to me.
Yeah.
Yeah, right.
- Really. - Sure.
Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.
Yeah, right.
Look. I'm sorry, alright?
I never meant for you to find out.
Oh, please!
Please! You wanted to get caught!
That is not true.
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Okay, Monica, I just have to know one thing.
[sighs]
Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
Ohh!
Okay.
Okay.
So what do you say, boys? Should I call him?
[slipper barks]
Well, you know what they say..
...ask your slippers a question.
You're going crazy.
[telephone rings]
- Hello? - 'Hey!'
Hey!
Listen, I'm-I'm sorry I didn't make it
over there today.
Oh, that's okay.
You, uh...you had a thing.
Yeah, well, I hear the place looks great.
Oh, forget about it.
I'm having a ball.
- How's the apartment doing? - Oh, hey, it's-it's terrific.
I mean, it's a regular space..
...fest.
Oh. Well, great.
Yeah, I just..
...you know, wanted to call and say hey.
Well, okay then.
[bell dings]
Was that the oven timer?
That's right, my friend!
'It's time for..'
(both) "Baywatch!"
Oh...can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant!
Oh, you're just saying that 'cause you're in love
with Yasmine Bleeth.
Well, how could anyone not be in love
with Yasmine Bleeth?
Hey! Hey! They're running!
(Chandler) 'See, this is the brilliance of the show!'
I say always keep them running.
All the time, running.
'Run!'
Run! Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
I did. I thought it'd be great.
I figured I'd have, like, time alone with my thoughts
but, you know, it turns out
I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
You really think he'd take me?
I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night
but when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
I'm telling you there's no way he's moving back.
But we had one of the greatest talks
we ever had last night.
I mean, it was..
...it was like when we first started living together.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now, but..
...we've seen him in his new place, alright
and he's happy.
He's...he's decorated.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, okay?
- You have to too. - But--
No, you're just gonna have to accept the fact
that you're just friends now, okay?
You're not... roommates anymore.
Alright, no peeking.
No peeking.
No peeking. No peeking!
Alright, alright, but you'd better be wearing clothes
when I open my eyes.
Alright. Open your eyes.
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Huh? "Days of Our Lives" picked up my option.
- Congratulations! - I know.
Now we can finally watch "Green Acres"
the way it was meant to be seen.
Uh-huh.
So, uh..
...which one is mine?
Whichever one you want, man.
Whichever one you want.
Not that one.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.
- Do we dare? - We dare.
- Ah. - Ah.
- Aah.. - Aah..
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice
so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
Well they were chair-shaped cows.
They never would have survived in the wild.
This screen is amazing.
I mean, Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
[all gasping]
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
- Hi, you guys. - 'Hey.'
Hey, you.
Hey, you.
- Hey, yo. - Whoa, hey.
So, uh, how was your day?
Oh, you know, pretty much the usual.
Uh...sun shining, birds chirping.
Really? Mine too.
Hey, cool, mine too.
[pager beeping] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got to get to the museum. So, um..
- I'll see you tonight? - Okay.
Oh.
Bye, guys.
Well, we did it. We're here.
We are standing our ground.
How long does a cup of coffee take?
Would you come on? Come on!
Thank you.
Well, there we go.
I think we proved our point.
- You burn your mouth? - Cannot feel my tongue.
Bullies. Big bullies.
Oh, look who's here.
It's the weenies.
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day?
Yes, and that's why we're here.
Yes. We're standing our ground.
Apparently.
- Let's do this, already. - Oh, oh, oh.
What do you got, there? A weapon?
It's a nice watch. I don't want to break it on your ribs.
- Huh. Alright, let's do this. - 'Alright.'
Question. If I don't care about my watch.
Can I use it as a weapon?
What do you mean?
Well, it's sharp. It's metal.
I think I can do some, you know
serious damage with it.
No, you can't use your watch.
Okay.
- Or your keys. - Okay.
Look, here's what we'll do.
We'll put all keys and watches
in the hat over there.
- 'Alright.' - Alright.
Alright, come on, man!
Let's do this already!
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
Of course, we are hitting faces. Why wouldn't you hit faces?
Well, because I have to work on Monday.
I have a big presentation.
Actually, you know, uh, I got to show this apartment tomorrow
and, uh, you know, this no-faces thing
might not be a bad idea.
Okay. Nothing from the neck up.
Alright.
Or the waist down.
- Dana's ovulating. - Oh, really?
- You guys trying again? - Yeah.
So let me just get this straight.
So, we're strictly talking about the middle?
- Come on! - Hey! Hey! Whoa! Oh!
You want some of this, huh?
You want a piece of this, huh?
I'm standing here! Huh?
Hey, hey! Those guys are taking our stuff!
Where? Hey!
- Get out of the way! - Look out! Hey!
God! That was, that was amazing.
That was incredible.
You guys, you guys kicked butt.
Us? What about you guys?
Man, you really, bing,
gave it to ol' Mr. Clean back there.
He was a big guy.
Yeah, he was, wasn't he?
You know, I wouldn't know, having missed everything.
- Oh! - Don't do that to yourself.
Anyone of us could have tripped over
that little girl's jump rope.
So, listen, guys, are we, uh..
...are we okay here?
- We're okay. - Alright.
Okay, so..
...can I have my hat back?
No.
Huh.
- Hi. - Hey, Ross. Bah!
Hi, Russ.
I've just got two more tables to clean
and then we'll go, okay?
Okay, I'll just sit here and, uh..
...chat with your, uh..
...friend...type..
...people.
[clears throat]
- Rachel. - Yeah.
- Um, hi. - Hi.
Okay, so you know what you're doing, right?
[chuckles] Waitressing?
Well, yeah, but no.
I mean, um, okay.
Doesn't-doesn't Russ
just remind you of someone?
Huh?
Bob Saget?
Oh, yeah.
No, no, no, no. Oh, oh.
- Hi. - Oh, my, oh.
Wha.. What's wrong?
I.. Okay.
She's just upset because she, uh, buttered
a spider into her toast this morning.
Alright.
Listen, Pheebs, this is gonna be okay.
Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
- Hi. - Hi.
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
Actually, I'm, uh, kind of, uh..
...you know, uh..
...date...type...thing
of Rachel's.
- A date? - Yeah.
I'm her date.
Oh, oh, you're, uh, you..
Oh, you're the date?
You know, this is actually good because if we ever lose Ross
we have a spare.
Oh, you are the uh, paleontologist.
Yes. Yes, I am.
And you are a..
Periodontist.
See, they're as different as night and..
...later that night.
Well, I am going to, uh, get a beverage.
Uh, it was nice-nice, uh, meeting you.
Ditto.
Okay, can we watch Joey's show now, please?
- Yeah. - Wait, he's not here yet.
So? He's on the show. He knows what happens.
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
Oh, good.
Amber.
I want you to know that I'll always be there for you.
As a friend and as your brother.
Oh, Drake.
(man on TV) 'What a day, huh?'
First, the medical award, now this.
Yeah, some guys are just lucky, I guess.
(woman on PA) 'Dr. Ramoray, report to first floor emergency, stat.'
[whimpers]
Well, then, uh
I, uh...guess that's me.
Anyone else need to go on the elevator?
Dr. Horton? Dr. Wong?
No, no. They only said you.
Well, okay.
- Alright. - I love you, Drake.
Yeah, whatever.
Oh, no!
(Amber) 'Drake! Look out!'
[screaming]
- Did they just kill off Joey? - No!
[thud]
Now maybe.
- 'Come on! Open up!' - 'Joey!'
(Ross) 'We want to talk to you.'
I don't feel like talking.
(Rachel) 'Oh, come on, Joey. We care about you.'
(Chandler) 'We're worried about you.'
(Monica) 'And some of us really have to pee.'
- Sorry, Joey. - Hey.
Listen, sorry about your death.
- That really sucks. - Yeah.
We came over as soon as we saw.
How could you not tell us?
I don't know, I was...kind of hoping
no one would ever find out.
Well, maybe they could find a way to bring you back.
Nah.
They said that when they found my body
my brain was so smashed in
that the only doctor who could have saved me was me.
Supposed to be some kind of irony or something.
But, Joey, you're gonna be fine.
You don't need that show. It was just a dumb soap opera.
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Yes. I was going to incorporate that.
Oh, good. Here's Monica.
She'll have something nice to say.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain
so you won't get mildew.
What? To me, that's nice.
It's gonna be okay. You know that.
No, I don't.
It's like, you know, you work your whole life for something
and you think that when you get it
it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be
but this so was.
You know, it changed everything.
Like, the other day I got this credit card application
and I was pre-approved.
'Huh?'
I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
I'm sorry, man.
Yeah. Joey, honey, I don't know if this will mean
anything to you, but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
No, that means nothing to me.
Hey, there.
- What? - Nothing.
I just..
...heard something nice about you.
Oh, really?
(Judy) 'Richard?'
Richard..
...your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?
Uh, not that I know of.
Well, I was thinking
why doesn't he give Monica a call?
That..
That's an idea.
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
- Oh? - Oh?
Oh..
[gasps]
She never tells us anything.
Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
Mom, there are so many people in my life.
Some of them are seeing people
and some of them aren't.
Is that crystal?
So, who's the mystery man?
Well, uh, he's a doctor.
A real doctor?
No, a doctor of meat.
Of course he's a real doctor.
And he's handsome.
And he's sweet, and I know you'd like him.
Well, that's wonderful.
I..
Mom, it's okay.
It is, Judy.
Jack.
Could you come in here for a moment?
- Now! - Found it.
I'll take that, dad.
It seems your daughter and Richard
are something of an item.
That's impossible.
He's got a twinkie in the city.
Dad, I'm the twinkie.
You're the twinkie?
She's not a twinkie.
Alright, look-look, you guys
this is the best relationship I've been in--
Oh, please! A relationship?
Yes, a relationship.
For your information, I am crazy about this man.
Really?
- Yes. - Wow.
Am I supposed to stand here
and listen to this on my birthday?
Dad, dad, this is a good thing for me.
You know and you even said yourself
you'd never seen Richard happier.
When did I say that?
Upstairs in the bathroom.
Right before you felt up mom.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday dear Jack ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪♪
Your mom wants to say goodbye.
Oh, okay.
Okay, Happy Birthday, sweetie.
Okay.
Uh...you drive safe.
Ross, what are you doing?
I'm getting ready for the water...skiing.
Okay, big hug. One more big hug. Come on.
'Alright, darling.'
How are you?
- Well, I.. - Dr. Green, where you going?
To get my coat.
- No, no, no! - I'll get that!
Alright! Alright! I can get my own coat.
[cheering and whooping]
Sorry. We're on a major flan high.
Oh, no.
No, you're not supposed to be here.
'Cause this is the staging area.
You should...it's all wrong. You should leave.
You know, just..
...get out.
[yelling]
Or perhaps you'd like a creme de menthe.
I have to be heading toward my chateau. Thank you.
Oh, alright, then I guess we're going back
[louder] into the hallway again.
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Green.
Okay.
You take care.
Oh, you kids!
[giggles]
Well..
This is the best party I've been to in years.
Thank you!
Did we speak on the phone last night?
- Did you call me? - No.
I stayed at Julie's last night.
Huh.
Oh, actually, I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?
Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you.
Who's Michael?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Ross, no. Hang up the phone!
Give me the phone, Ross! Give me the phone!
Give me the phone! Give me the..!
- You're over me? - Oh, God!
Wha..you're uh..
...you're...you're over me?
Oh my God!
Oh!
When...when were you..
...under me?
(Ross) 'Rach?'
Rachel, do you..
'...I mean, were you, uh..'
- What? - 'Okay, okay.'
Well..
...basically, lately I've, uh..
I've, uh, sort of had feelings for you.
[sighs]
You've...had feelings for me.
Yeah? What? So? You had feelings for me first.
Whoa! Huh!
You know about my..
I mean, you know I had..
You-you know?
You..
- Chandler told me. - Chandler.
When did he, when did he, when did he?
- When you were in China. - China.
- Meeting Julie. - Julie. Julie.
That's...oh, God.
Julie, Julie.
Right. Okay, I need to lie down.
No, you know, I'm going to stand.
I'm going to stand and I'm going to walk.
I'm walking and... I am standing.
Okay, so you, uh..
And now, what...and now, now
now you're over me?
Are you over me?
[Ross playing "Axel F"]
(Rachel) Oh, my God! Look, there's Roy Gublick!
You know, Roy saw star wars 317 times.
His name was in the paper.
Where's Chip? Why isn't he here yet?
He'll be here, okay? Take a chill pill.
There.
[chuckling] I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
I can't go to my own prom without a date.
I can't. It's too late.
You know, if you're not going, I don't wanna go either.
- Oh. - Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.
I have a wonderful idea.
You should take Rachel to the prom.
Mom, uh...huh...doubtful.
Jack, give me that.
Talk to your son.
- I got it. This thing is heavy. - Okay, okay, okay.
Your mother's right. Take her.
You could wear my tux.
Dad, she won't wanna go with me.
(Jack on tape) 'Of course, she would.'
'You're a college man.'
- I don't know. - Well, come on.
Don't you wanna find out?
[sobbing] Oh, my God, I can't believe
I don't get to go to my own prom.
This is so harsh.
Okay.
- Hold my board. - Atta boy. Atta boy.
(Ross) 'Okay, you guys, you know, I think we've seen enough.'
- Let's turn it off. - No, no, no.
Okay, fine. Well, I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Come on, kid. Let's go.
(Judy) 'Boy! are you handsome.'
- 'Let's show them.' - Alright, just a sec, dad.
Just be cool. Just be cool.
Okay, dad.
Rachel, ready or not..
...here comes your knight in shining..
Oh, no.
- Bye, don't wait up! - Bye, you guys!
Okay, Chip!
(Judy) 'Oh, dear.'
'Jack, how do I turn this off?'
- 'Press the button.' - 'Which one? Which button?
- 'Jack?' - 'The button. The button.'
I can't believe you did that.
Yeah, well..
Okay, and then you take the poopy diaper
and you put it in the poopy diaper pail.
Okay, Ross, just so you know calling it a "Poopy diaper"
doesn't make this process any cuter.
[intercom buzzes]
- Hello. - 'It's us.'
Come on up.
I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
Okay, we can do this now, can't we, Ben?
Yes, we can.
Yes, we can.
There. I did it.
Oh-ho. I did it.
Ooh!
Look at that.
Oh! It stays on and everything.
- Hi. - Hi.
I'm sorry.
What did you just say?
Did you just say "Hi?" Oh, my God.
Ross, Ross, Ben just said "Hi."
- Wha-what? - Ben just said "Hi."
What, the word "Hi?"
Yeah, no, my Uncle Hy.
Great. Great. And I missed that too.
- I miss everything. - Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess I just bring it out in him.
[knock on door]
Hello. Where is he?
- Yeah. - We missed you so much.
Come here, Ben.
Hi.
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
- What did he say? - What did he say?
Something about "Hi."
Oh, that's so exciting.
Mommy's so proud of you.
Hi. Hi.
You know, actually, it's more like "Hi!"
- Hi. - Hi.
- Hi. - Hi.
- Hi. - Hi.
Okay, this could go on for a while.
You're right. We got a cab waiting downstairs.
Well, this was fun.
Uh, we should really do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say? Okay.
So I've got him..
- Tuesday. - Tuesday, right.
- Okay, bye, you guys. - See you.
- Take care. - Bye, Ben.
(Ben) 'Bye.'
Did-did he just... did he just say "Bye?"
He said "Bye." He said "Bye" to me!
You said-he said "Bye" to me!
Yes, he did.
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
We got to go. We got that cab downstairs.
Okay. Alright, alright.
- Okay. - See you later.
- Alright - Bye.
(Ben) 'Bye.'
Bye!
(Ben) 'Bye.'
- Bye! - 'Bye.'
Bye!
Ahh..
- Hey, Erika. Come on in. - How did you get here so fast?
- I just saw you in Salem. - Right.
They, uh, they choppered me in.
What's up?
And I see you're having a little party too.
- Is she here? Huh, huh? - Who?
Sabrina. I know about you two.
I saw you today, kissing in the doctors' lounge.
That's not what you think. That was--
You told me I was the only one.
Alright, look, that's it.
I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright?
Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago
but I am not Drake Ramoray, okay?
I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor.
I just pretend to be a doctor.
Oh, my God, do the people at the hospital know about this?
Somebody want to help me out here?
Oh, I know. I know.
- Where am I? - University Hospital.
The same place you've been for the last 18 years.
How-how can you be here and there?
'Cause it's a television show.
Drake, what are you getting at?
- I'm not Drake. - That's right.
He's not Drake.
He's...Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin.
Is this true?
Yes, yes, it is true.
And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake
to-to sleep with me.
And then he told me he would run away with me.
And he didn't!
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard!
Is all this true?
Yes. I'm afraid it is.
You deserve much better than me, Erika.
You deserve to be with the real Drake.
He's the one you fell in love with.
Go to Salem. Find him.
He's the guy for you.
Oh, Hans.
Hans? Hans?
Yo, evil twin!
Right. Uh, goodbye, Erika.
Good luck in Salem.
- Take care. - I'll never forget you, Hans.
(Joey) 'Hey!'
Mr. Douglas, is looking for you.
Why? W-w-why?
Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
'Cause, he has a strong suspicion
that you dropped the ball on the lender project.
What.. W-why? Why-why does he suspect that?
Because at first he thought it was Joseph.
But after he asked Joseph about it..
...turns out it was you.
Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Alright, that's it!
Look, Joey, I'm sorry.
I realize this is the role of a lifetime for you
and if I could just fire Joseph, I would
but unfortunately that's not possible.
So I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
What are you talking about? Everybody loves Joseph.
I don't. I hate Joseph.
Okay? I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you can't fire Joseph. You know why?
'Cause he's not in your department.
[scoffs]
Ha ha.
Alright, okay.
Alright, so I can't fire Joseph
but, uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Not Karen? Yeah, Karen.
I'm thinking about having an affair with her.
Oh, you know what? I just did.
[gasps]
What the hell are you doing to me, man?
Oh. Well, it's not me.
It's my character.
Chandy.
Yeah, the rogue processor who seduces his co-workers' wives
for sport and then laughs about it
the next day at the water cooler.
In fact, I have her panties
right there in my drawer.
- Really? - No, freak show!
- She's fictional! - Whoa! Hey!
Take it easy.
If it means that much to you I'll, uh..
...I'll go find something else.
[sighs] Thank you.
It's just that..
I'm-I'm gonna miss Joseph.
I liked him. His wife...she was hot.
Ow!
[instrumental music]
[whistling]
[Chandler whistles]
[Joey whistles]
- 'Joey?' - Ma?
(Chandler) 'Joey!'
Chandler?
What are you still doing here?
I thought you guys took off.
'Oh, no, no. She took off.'
'With my clothes!'
- Are you naked in there? - 'Well, not exactly.'
'I'm wearing panties.'
Huh.
You, uh...you always wear panties?
'No, no. This is the first time.'
Wow, talk about your bad luck.
I mean, the first time you try panties
and someone walks off with your clothes.
I was not trying them out.
Susie asked me to wear them.
- Well, let me see. - No.
'I'm not letting you or anybody else see ever.'
Alright, alright.
Whoa.
Someone's flossing.
Joey, uh, some people don't like that.
Chandler's wearing panties.
What? Let me see.
'No, no. You don't have to see.'
Hi, tushie.
Alright. One of you give me your underpants.
Oh, no. No, no.
Can't help you. I'm not wearing any.
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Oh, I'm getting heat from the guy
in the hot pink thong.
Alright, look. Ross.
I'll give you $50 for your underpants.
- Hey. - Hey.
Come on, Chandler.
I want this part so much.
Just one kiss. I won't tell anyone.
Joey, no means no.
- Hey, hi. - Hey.
I'm sorry. W-we don't have your sheep.
Oh, Rach, I think you look cute.
And you, huh! You..
You I could eat with a spoon.
Get away from me. I said no.
Hey, guys, Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Oh, Richard's here?
I should run down and say goodbye to him.
- Bye. Good luck. - Bye.
So, how's your date with your cyber-chick going?
Ooh, hey, what is all that?
Oh, it's a web site.
It's the Guggenheim Museum.
See, uh, she likes art, and...I like funny words.
[clears throat]
What does she mean by "HH"?
It...means we're holding hands.
Are you the cutest?
I'm afraid I might just be.
You know what I think is so great?
That you are totally into this person
and yet, for all you know, she could be, like
90 years old or have two heads, or..
...it could be a guy.
Okay, it's not a guy, alright?
I know her.
It could be, like, a big, giant guy.
Man, I got this close to him
and Monica kneed me in the back.
What's going on?
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend's a girl.
Oh, just ask her how long she's going to live.
Women live longer than men.
How do you not fall down more?
Okay, ask her what is her
current method of birth control.
Alright.
[clears throat]
"My husband is sleeping with his secretary."
She's married?
Well, at least we know she's a woman.
I can't believe she's married.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
This must be really tough for you, huh?
Oh...God!
Oh, God! I mean, it's just so..
Isn't it?
I mean, this is like reading about my own life.
I mean, this book could-could have been called
"Be Your Own Wind-Keeper, Rachel."
I don't think it would have sold a million copies
but it would've made a nice gift for you.
- Hey, you guys. - Hey.
Uh, sweetie, we've got to go.
No!
No?
No, why do we always have to do everything
according to your timetable?
Actually, it's the movie theater that has the timetable.
It's so you don't miss the beginning.
No. See, this isn't about the movie theater.
This is about you stealing my wind.
You go, girl!
I can't pull that off, can I?
Excuse me, your..
...your, your wind?
Yes. My wind.
How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
You, you know I...I don't have a..
...have a, a problem with that.
Okay.
I just...I just really need to be
with myself right now.
- I'm sorry. - Mm-mm-mm.
Uh, you're right.
I don't have to apologize.
Sorry. Damn it!
Hey, Rach, want to hear the new song
I'm thinking of singing this afternoon?
I wrote it this morning in the shower.
Okay. Right.
♪ I'm in the shower ♪
♪ And I'm writing a song ♪
♪ Stop me if you've heard it ♪
♪ My skin is soapy ♪
♪ And my hair is wet ♪
♪ And tegrin spelled backward ♪

Uh, Rachel, sweetheart.
Could I see you for a minute?
- What's up? - Uh.
FYI, I've decided to pay
a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.
Her name is Stephanie... something.
I, uh, she's supposed to be very good.
But w-what about Phoebe?
Rachel, uh, it's not that your friend is bad.
It's...it's that she's so bad..
...she makes me want to put my finger
through my eye, into my brain
and swirl it around.
Okay.
Okay, so you're not a fan.
But, I mean, come on. You cannot do this to her.
Uh..
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, no.
I have to do this to her?

But-but this is my gig!
I mean, this is where I play.
My-my name is written out there in chalk.
You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Honey, I'm sorry.
And he's going to be paying this woman?
Why doesn't he just give her, like, a throne?
And a crown, and-and like a...you know..
...gold stick with a ball on top?
Terry is a jerk. Okay?
That's why we're always saying, "Terry's a jerk."
That's where that came from.
Yeah, okay.
You probably did everything you could, so..
Okay, you know what?
Let-let me just see what else I can do.
Alright, look, look.
Why don't you just let her go on after
Stephanie... whatever her name is.
I mean, you won't be here, you don't pay her.
It's not gonna cost you anything.
I-I-I don't know.
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
Uh, of course..
...I clean it.
I mean, I-I will clean it.
I mean, I will clean it.
Oh, alright. Fine.
Fine, fine.
- Done. - Really?
Yeah. Who's working for you, babe?
Oh, oh, my God!
- This is so exciting. - I know.
How much am I going to get?
- What? - Well.
You said he's paying the people who were playing, so..
Oh, no. No, no. I-I meant..
He's going to be paying that other woman..
...because she's a professional.
Well...I'm not going to be the only one
who's not getting paid.
- Oh, but, Phoebes-- - No, uh-uh, I'm sorry.
No, no, I'm not some, like, sloppy second..
...you know, charity band... and you know what?
There are thousands of places in this city
where people would be happy to pay to hear me play.
♪ When I play I play for me ♪
♪ I don't need your charity ♪
Thank you.
- Oh. - Hello.
Oh. Thanks. I couldn't, uh..
- Is everything okay? - Um, no.
(Phoebe) 'Huh-uh. Um..'
One of my clients died
on the massage table today.
- Oh! - Oh, my God.
That's a little more relaxed than you
want them to get.
Yeah, uh-huh.
Um, she was, you know, 82 years old
and, um, her name was, um, Mrs. Adelman.
Oh, honey.
Yeah, it's just so strange, I mean..
You know, she probably woke up this morning and thought
"Alright, so I'll have some breakfast
"and I'll take a little walk
"and, and, you know, then I'll have my massage."
Little did she know God was thinking
"Okay, but that's it."
Oh! Oh, but the weirdest thing was, okay, um..
I was cleansing her aura when it happened.
And when, when her spirit left her body
I don't think it went very far.
What do you mean?
I, I, I think it went into me.
- Ooh, that's him. - Damn.
My mail-order grandfather hasn't come yet.
- Phoebe? - Yes. Hi, Mr. Adelman.
- Nice to see you. - Hi. Thanks for meeting me.
Oh, that's alright, although you did
cut into my very busy day of sitting.
Oh. Um, oh, do you want to sit?
Oh, no, no. Please.
I spent most of mid-morning
trying to stand up.
Now, what can I do for you, my dear?
Oh, okay, I don't know how to say this, but, um..
I think when your wife's spirit left her body
it, um, kind of stuck around..
...in me.
You're saying my wife is in you?
Yeah, okay, you don't have to believe me
but, um, can you think of any
unfinished business she might have had?
Like, any reason she'd be hanging around?
Well, I don't know what to tell you, dear.
The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say
that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
- Everything? - Everything.
- Whoa. That's a lot of stuff. - Oh, wait, I, I, I remember.
She also said she wanted to sleep with me
one last time.
Uh, I'm sorry.
There's laughing in my head.
Worth a shot, huh?
Now, what have I not told you?
Oh, I don't know.
Um, ahem, how about the fact
that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours
from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby
out on the terrace.
- What? - What?
Wait a minute, who told you?
You are dead meat.
I didn't know it was a big secret.
Huh, oh, it's not big, not at all.
You know, kind of on the same lines as, say
oh, I don't know, having a third nipple!
[gasping]
(Ross) 'What?'
You have a third nipple?
You bitch.
- Whip it out. Whip it out. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No! Come on!
There's nothing to see. It's just a tiny bump.
It's totally useless.
Oh, as-as opposed to your other
multifunctional nipples.
I can't believe you.
You told me it was a nubbin.
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
I don't know. You see something. You hear a word.
I thought that's what it was.
- Let me see it again. - Yeah, show it to us.
Show us the nubbin. Your nubbin.
Joey was in a porno movie.
[gasping]
If I'm going down, I'm taking everybody with me.
- Oh, my God! - You were in a porno?
A-a-alright, alright, alright.
I was young, and I just wanted a job, okay?
But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it.
So they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier
but can't, 'cause there's people having sex on it.
(together) Wow!
That is wild!
[chuckling]
So what's it shaped like?
Yeah, is there a hair on it?
What happens if you flick it?
[knock on floor]
Oh, stop with the broom!
We're not making noise!
[knock on floor]
Oh, God.
[knock on floor]
- We won. - We did?
[cheering]
[groaning]
Mr. Heckles.
How did this happen?
Uh, he must have been sweeping.
They found a broom in his hand.
- Oh. - Oh, God.
- That's terrible. - I know.
I was sweepin' yesterday.
- It could have been me. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(Joey) 'Sure, sure.'
- Sweeping. - Right.
- You never know. - Never know.
[instrumental music]
[knock on door]
Uh-oh. It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.
Oh, there she is, right over there.
'That's the other one.'
'This is Mr. Buddy Boyle'
Heckles' attorney.
He'd like to talk to you.
Okay, w-what can we do for you?
Alright, kids.
Here's the deal.
According to my client's will
he wants to leave all his earthly possessions
to the, uh, "noisy girls in the apartment above mine."
Well, what about his family?
He didn't have any.
(Joey) 'Whoa.'
Oh, okay, so let's talk money.
Alright. There was none.
Now, let's talk signing.
You be noisy girl number one.
You be noisy girl number two.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us.
I mean, isn't it amazing
how much you can touch someone's life
without even knowing it?
- Would you look at this dump? - He hated us.
This was his final revenge.
Ever seen so much crap?
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap.
Check this out.
Woo!
He's going to get my coat.
He's going to get my coat!
Oh, my God, you guys, I can't believe this!
This is unbelievable!
- What's that? - What? Nothing!
What is that? I saw my name. What is it?
No, no. See? See?
[printer whirring]
Hey, it's printing!
Hey, it's printing!
Well, what is it? Let me see.
Hey, someone order a coat?
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer
and he won't let me see.
He won't, he won't?
He..
...because isn't that, isn't that the..
...the-the short story you were writing?
Yes, yes, it is the short story..
...that I was writing.
And I'm in it? Well, let me read it!
(in unison) No!
- Come on! - Hey!
Uh, why don't you read it to her?
Alright!
"It was summer.
"And it was hot!
"Rachel was there."
Huh?
"A lonely gray couch!
"Oh, look, cried Ned!
"And then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
That's it? That's all you wrote?
You're the worst writer in the whole world!
Alright-alright, you know what? This isn't funny anymore.
There's something about me on that piece of paper
and I want to see it.
No, you don't.
Alright, you know what? Fine.
If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine.
I do not need to see it!
[yelling]
Go, go, go!
(Joey) 'Ooh!'
What is this?
- That is.. - That's, that's..
- Ross, what is this? - Thank you.
(Joey) Good luck.
Okay, just-just remember how crazy I am about you, okay?
"Kind of ditzy?"
[clears throat] "Too into her looks?"
"Spoiled?"
Now, that's, "A little spoiled."
He was supposed to type, little, the idiot.
"Just a waitress?"
Now, that, that was, uh..
I mean, as opposed to, uh..
...the, uh... okay, is-is this over yet?
- Rach? - Oh!
I do not have chubby ankles!
No, I, no, no, Rach!
Okay-okay, look at the other side.
Look at Julie's column.
"She's not rachem?"
- No. - What the hell's a rachem?
Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know
because I'm just a waitress?
Rach, come on! Rach..
Rach! Rach! No, no, no!
It's, "She's not Rachel!"
She's...she's not..
Ra.. Rachel?
Oh, hi.
Yeah, hold on a sec.
Ross, Julie for you.
(Ross) 'Hello? Hi.'
Hey, anybody know a good tailor?
You need some clothes altered?
No, no, I'm just looking for a man
to draw on me with chalk.
Why don't you go see Frankie?
My family's been going to him forever.
He did my first suit when I was 15.
No, wait. 16.
No. Excuse me. 15.
Alright, when was 1990?
Okay, you have to stop the q-tip
when there's resistance.
Okay, okay, sweetheart
I'll see you later.
Okay, bye. What?
Oh, that is so sweet.
No, no, okay.
No, you hang up.
No, you...okay.
Okay. One, two, three.
Well, you didn't hang up either.
(both) She didn't hang up either.
Okay, no.
No, you hang up.
You. You. Y..
I'm sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
Rachel..
- I'll just call her back. - Okay.
(Ross) 'I'm sorry, we got disconnected.'
Okay, okay, okay, okay, how did this happen to me?
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.
Now, all of a sudden, he's Ross..
Oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
I know you did.
I'm just going to deal with it.
[kissing]
I got to get out of here.
Okay, I don't care what you guys say.
Something is bothering her.
Hi! Welcome to our tropical Christmas party.
You can put your coats and sweaters
and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating.
But, I use exactly what the gel bottle says.
An amount about the size of a pea.
How, how can that be too much?
(Monica) 'Ice?'
Ice? Ice squares, anyone?
Take a napkin.
Alright.
Monica. Monica!
Monica, your guests are turning into jerky, okay?
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.
Hey, hey, hey, get in line, buddy. I was next.
Mr. Treeger.
Uh, you said there was a party.
Oh, yeah.
Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.
Oh, is it hot?
My body always stays cool.
Probably because I have so much skin.
Hey, cheese.
Alright. Alright, here's the chance.
Monica, give him cash. Rachel, give him your earrings.
Uh, something. Now. Anything.
No. I will not cave.
- Yeah, I'm with Mon. - Alright. Alright.
You know how you say I never seize the day?
Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing.
Mr. Treeger?
Here is 50 bucks. Merry Christmas.
Oh, wow. I didn't get you anything.
[chuckles]
Here's five back.
No, no. No, that's, that's your Christmas tip.
Alright? Oh, hey.
Do you think there's a chance you can fix that radiator now?
Oh, no can do. Like I told the girl.
I can't get a new knob until Tuesday.
- Ross? - Yeah.
Looks like he's playing baseball.
You mean hardball?
Whatever.
What you gonna do?
Excuse me. I'm seizing.
Mr. Treeger.
Here's another 50.
Happy Hanukkah.
Will, uh, will this help with the knob-getting?
No. The place is not open till Tuesday.
Am I not saying it right?
So, wait...you really did like my cookies?
Oh, yeah. They were so personal.
It really showed you cared.
Nice seizing...gel-boy.
