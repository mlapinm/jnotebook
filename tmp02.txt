Docstring:
Save a set of lines or a macro to a given filename.

Usage:
  %save [options] filename n1-n2 n3-n4 ... n5 .. n6 ...

Options:

  -r: use 'raw' input.  By default, the 'processed' history is used,
  so that magics are loaded in their transformed version to valid
  Python.  If this option is given, the raw input as typed as the
  command line is used instead.
  
  -f: force overwrite.  If file exists, %save will prompt for overwrite
  unless -f is given.

  -a: append to the file instead of overwriting it.
