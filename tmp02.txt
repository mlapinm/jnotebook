so in this first section I'm going to
00:05
spend a few minutes discussing the
00:06
difference between artificial
00:08
intelligence neural networks and machine
00:10
learning now the reason we need to go
00:12
into this is because we're gonna be
00:13
covering all of these topics throughout
00:15
this course so it's vital that you guys
00:16
understand what these actually mean and
00:18
you can kind of differentiate between
00:20
them so that's we're gonna focus on now
00:22
now quick disclaimer here just so
00:23
everyone's aware I'm using something
00:25
called Windows Inc this just default
00:27
comes with Windows I have a drawing
00:29
tablet down here and this is what I'm
00:30
gonna be using for some of the
00:31
explanatory parts but there's no real
00:33
coding I'm just to kind of illustrate
00:35
some concepts and topics to you now I
00:37
have very horrible handwriting I'm not
00:39
artistic whatsoever programming is
00:42
definitely more of my thing than you
00:44
know drawing and doing diagrams and
00:46
stuff but I'm gonna try my best and this
00:48
is just the way that I find I can convey
00:50
information the best to you guys so
00:52
anyways let's get started and discuss
00:53
the first topic here which is artificial
00:55
intelligence now artificial intelligence
00:57
is a huge hype nowadays and it's funny
01:00
because a lot of people actually don't
01:01
know what this means or they try to tell
01:03
people that what they've created is not
01:05
artificial intelligence when in reality
01:07
it actually is now the kind of formal
01:10
definition of AI and I'm just gonna read
01:12
it off of my slide here to make sure
01:13
that I'm not messing this up is the
01:15
effort to automate intellectual tasks
01:17
normally performed by humans now that's
01:20
a fairly big definition right what is
01:22
considered an intellectual task and you
01:25
know really that doesn't help us too
01:27
much so what I'm gonna do is bring us
01:29
back to when AI was creeped first
01:30
created to kind of explain to you how AI
01:32
has evolved and what it really started
01:34
out being so back in 1950 there was kind
01:37
of the question being asked by
01:39
scientists and researchers can computers
01:41
think can we get them to figure things
01:43
out can we get away from just hard
01:45
coding and you know having like can we
01:47
get a computer to think can it do its
01:49
own thing so that was kind of the
01:51
question that was asked and that's when
01:52
the term artificial intelligence was
01:54
kind of coined and created now back then
01:57
AI was simply a predefined set of rules
02:00
so if you're thinking about an AI for
02:01
maybe like tic-tac-toe or an AI for
02:04
chess all they would have had back then
02:06
is predefined rules that humans had come
02:08
up with and typed into the computer in
02:10
code and the computer would simply
02:12
execute those set of rules and follow
02:14
those instructions
02:15
so there was no deep learning machine
02:17
learning crazy algorithms happening it
02:19
was simply if you wanted the computer to
02:20
do something you would have to tell it
02:22
beforehand say you're in this position
02:24
and this happens do this and that's what
02:26
AI was and very good AI was simply just
02:29
a very good set of rules were a ton of
02:31
different rules that humans have
02:33
implemented into some program you can
02:35
have AI programs that are stretching you
02:37
know half a million lines of code just
02:39
with tons and tons and tons of different
02:41
rules that have been created for that AI
02:43
so just be aware that AI does not
02:46
necessarily mean anything crazy complex
02:49
or super complicated but essentially if
02:51
you're trying to simulate some
02:53
intellectual task like playing a game
02:55
that a human would do with a computer
02:57
that is considered AI so even a very
02:59
basic artificial intelligence for a
03:01
tic-tac-toe game where it plays against
03:03
you that is still considered AI and if
03:05
we think of something like pac-man right
03:07
where we have you know our little ghosts
03:08
and this will be my rough sketch of a
03:10
ghost we have our pac-man guy who will
03:13
just be this well would we consider this
03:15
ghost AI what it does is it attempts to
03:18
find and kind of simulate how it would
03:21
get to pac-man right and the way this
03:23
works is just using a very basic
03:24
pathfinding algorithm this is nothing to
03:27
do with deep learning or machine
03:28
learning or anything crazy but this is
03:30
still considered artificial intelligence
03:32
the computer is figuring out how it can
03:34
kind of play and do something by
03:36
following an algorithm so we don't
03:37
necessarily need to have anything crazy
03:39
stupid complex to be considered AI it
03:42
simply needs to just be simulating some
03:44
intellectual human behavior that's kind
03:46
of the definition of artificial
03:48
intelligence now obviously today AI has
03:51
evolved into a much more complex field
03:53
where we now have machine learning and
03:54
deep learning and all these other
03:55
techniques which is what we're going to
03:57
talk about now so what I want to start
03:59
by doing is just drawing a circle here
04:01
and I want to label this circle and say
04:03
a I like that so this is gonna define AI
04:06
because everything I'm about to put
04:08
inside of here is considered artificial
04:10
intelligence so now let's get into
04:12
machine learning so what I'm gonna do is
04:14
draw another circle inside of here we're
04:17
gonna label this circle ml for machine
04:19
learning now notice I put this inside of
04:22
the artificial intelligence circle this
04:23
is because machine learning is a part of
04:26
artificial intelligence now what
04:28
machine whirring well what we talked
04:31
about previously was kind of the idea
04:33
that AI used to just be a predefined set
04:36
of rules right what would happen is we
04:38
would feed some data we would go through
04:41
the rules by and then analyze the data
04:43
with the rules and then we'd spit out
04:44
some output which would be you know what
04:46
we're gonna do so in the classic example
04:48
of chess say we're in check well we
04:50
passed that board information to the
04:52
computer it looks at it sets of rules it
04:54
determines we're in check and then it
04:55
moves us somewhere else now what is
04:58
machine learning in contrast to that
04:59
well machine learning is kind of the
05:01
first field that it's actually figuring
05:03
out the rules for us so rather than us
05:06
hard coding the rules into the computer
05:08
what machine learning attempts to do is
05:10
take the data and take what the output
05:12
should be and figure out the rules for
05:14
us so you'll often hear that you know
05:16
machine learning requires a lot of data
05:18
and you need ton of examples and you
05:20
know input data to really train a good
05:23
model well the reason for that is
05:25
because the way that machine learning
05:26
works is it generates the rules for us
05:29
we give it some input data we give it
05:31
what the output data should be and then
05:33
it looks at that information and figures
05:35
out what rules can we generate so that
05:38
when we look at new data we can have the
05:40
best possible output for that now that's
05:42
also why a lot of the times machine
05:44
learning models do not have a hundred
05:45
percent accuracy which means that they
05:48
may not necessarily get the correct
05:49
answer every single time and our goal
05:52
when we create machine learning models
05:54
is to raise our accuracy as high as
05:55
possible which means it's gonna make the
05:57
fewest mistakes possible because just
05:59
like a human you know our machine
06:01
learning models which are trying to
06:02
simulate you know human behavior can
06:05
make mistakes but as summarized that
06:06
essentially machine learning the
06:08
difference between that and kind of you
06:10
know algorithms and basic artificial
06:13
intelligence is the fact that rather get
06:15
that rather than us the programmer
06:17
giving it the rules it figures out the
06:19
rules for us and we might not
06:21
necessarily know explicitly what those
06:23
rules are when we look at machine
06:25
learning and create machine learning
06:26
models but we know that we're giving
06:28
some input data we're giving the
06:30
expected output data and then it looks
06:32
at all of that information does some
06:34
algorithms which we'll talk about later
06:35
on that and figures out the rules for us
06:38
so that later when we give it some input
06:40
data and we don't know
06:41
the output data it can use those rules
06:43
that it's figured out from our examples
06:45
and all that training data that we gave
06:47
it to generate some output okay so
06:49
that's machine learning now we've
06:51
covered AI and machine learning and now
06:53
it's time to cover neural networks or
06:55
deep learning now this circle gets to go
06:57
right inside of the machine learning
06:59
right here I'm just gonna label this one
07:01
NN which stands for neural networks now
07:04
neural networks get a big hype they're
07:06
usually what the first you know when you
07:07
get into machine learning you want to
07:09
learn neural networks you're kind of
07:10
like neural networks are cool they're
07:12
capable of a lot but let's discuss what
07:14
these really are so the easiest way to
07:16
define a neural network is it as a form
07:18
of machine learning that uses a layered
07:21
representation of data now we're not
07:23
gonna really understand this completely
07:25
right now but as we get further in that
07:27
should start to make more sense as a
07:28
definition but what I need to kind of
07:31
illustrate to you is that in the
07:32
previous example we just talked about
07:34
machine learning essentially what we had
07:35
is we had some input bubbles which I'm
07:37
going to define as these we had some set
07:39
of rules that is gonna be in between
07:41
here and then we had some output and
07:43
what would happen is we feed this input
07:44
to this set of rules something happens
07:47
in here and then we get some output and
07:49
then that is what you know our program
07:52
does or that's what we get from the
07:53
model we pretty much just have two
07:55
layers we have kind of the input layer
07:57
the output layer and the rules are kind
07:59
of just what connects those two layers
08:01
together now in neural networks and what
08:04
we call deep learning we have more than
08:07
two layers now I'm just trying to erase
08:08
all this quickly so I can show you that
08:10
so let's say and I'll draw this one
08:12
another color because why not if we're
08:14
talking about neural networks what we
08:16
might have and this will vary and I'll
08:18
talk about this in a second is the fact
08:20
that we have an input layer which will
08:21
be our first layer of data we could have
08:23
some layers in between this layer that
08:25
are all connected together and then we
08:28
could have some output layer so
08:30
essentially what happens is our data is
08:33
going to be transformed through
08:35
different layers and different things
08:37
are gonna happen there's gonna be
08:38
different connections between these
08:41
layers and then eventually we will reach
08:43
an output now it's very difficult to
08:45
explain neural networks without going
08:46
completely in depth so I'll cover a few
08:48
more notes that I have here essentially
08:51
in neural networks we just have multiple
08:53
layers that's kind of the way to
08:54
think of them and as we see machine
08:57
learning you guys should start to
08:58
understand this more but just understand
09:00
that we're dealing with multiple layers
09:02
and a lot of people actually call this a
09:04
multi stage information extraction
09:06
process now I did not come up with that
09:08
term I think that's from a book or
09:10
something but essentially what ends up
09:12
happening is we have our data at this
09:14
first layer which is that input
09:15
information which we're going to be
09:16
passing to the model that we're gonna do
09:18
something with it then goes to another
09:20
layer where it will be transformed it
09:22
will change into something else using a
09:25
predefined kind of set of rules and
09:28
weights that we'll talk about later then
09:30
it will pass through all these different
09:32
layers we're different kind of features
09:34
of the data which again we'll discuss in
09:35
a second will be extracted will be
09:38
figured out will be found until
09:40
eventually we reach an output layer
09:41
where we can kind of combine everything
09:43
we've discovered about the data into
09:45
some kind of output that's meaningful to
09:47
our program so that's kind of the best
09:49
that I can do to explain their own
09:51
networks without going on to a deeper
09:52
level I understand that a lot of you
09:54
probably don't understand what they are
09:55
right now and that's totally fine
09:57
but just know that there are layered
09:59
representation of data we have multiple
10:01
layers of information whereas in
10:03
standard machine learning we only have
10:05
you know one or two layers and in
10:07
artificial intelligence in general we
10:10
don't necessarily have to have like a
10:11
predefined set of layers
10:13
okay so that is pretty much it for
10:16
neural networks there's one last thing I
10:18
will say about them is that they're
10:19
actually not modeled after the brain so
10:22
a lot of people seem to think that
10:23
neural networks are modeled after the
10:25
brain and the fact that you have neurons
10:26
firing in your brain and that can relate
10:29
to neural networks now there is a
10:30
biological inspiration for the name
10:33
neural networks in the way that they
10:34
work from you know human biology but is
10:37
not necessarily modeled about the way
10:39
that our brain works and in fact we
10:41
actually don't really know how a lot of
10:43
the things in our brain operate and work
10:45
so it would be impossible for us to say
10:46
that neural networks are modeled after
10:48
the brain because we actually don't know
10:50
how information is kind of happens and
10:52
occurs and transfers through our brain
10:54
or at least we don't know enough to be
10:56
able to say this is exactly what it is
10:58
a neural network so anyways that was
10:59
kind of the last point there okay so now
11:02
we need to talk about data now Donna is
11:04
the most important part of machine
11:06
and artificial intelligence neural
11:08
networks as well and it's very important
11:10
that we understand how important data is
11:13
and what the different kind of parts of
11:15
it are because they're gonna be
11:16
referenced a lot in any of the resources
11:18
that we're using now what I want to do
11:20
is just create an example here where I'm
11:21
gonna make a data set that is about
11:24
students final grades in like a school
11:27
system so essentially we're gonna make
11:28
this a very easy example where all we're
11:30
gonna have for this data set is we're
11:32
gonna have information about students so
11:34
we're gonna have their midterm 1 grade
11:36
their midterm 2 grade and then we're
11:38
gonna have their final grade so I'm just
11:40
gonna say mid term 1 and again excuse my
11:45
handwriting here it's not the easiest
11:46
thing to write with this drawing tablet
11:48
and then I'll just do final so this is
11:51
gonna be our data set and we'll actually
11:53
see some similar data sets to this as we
11:55
go through and do some examples later on
11:57
so for a student 1 which we'll just put
11:59
some students here we're gonna have
12:02
their midterm 1 grade maybe that's a 70
12:04
their midterm 2 grade maybe that was an
12:06
80 and then let's say their final was
12:08
like their final term grade not just the
12:10
mark on the final exam let's give them a
12:13
77 now for midterm 1 can give someone a
12:16
60 maybe we give them a 90 and then we
12:18
determined that the final grade on their
12:20
exam was let's say an 84 and then we can
12:23
do something with maybe a lower grade
12:25
here so 4050 and then maybe they got a
12:29
38 or something in the final grade now
12:32
obviously we could have some other
12:34
information here that were omitting look
12:36
maybe there was some exam some
12:37
assignments whatever some other things
12:38
they did that contributed to their grade
12:40
but the problem that I want to consider
12:42
here is the fact that given our midterm
12:44
1 grade and our midterm 2 grade and our
12:46
final grade how can I use this
12:48
information to predict any one of these
12:50
three columns so if I were given a
12:53
student's midterm 1 grade and I were
12:55
given a student's final grade how could
12:57
I predict their midterm 2 grade so this
13:01
is where we're gonna talk about features
13:02
and labels now whatever information we
13:05
have that is the input information which
13:07
is the information we will always have
13:09
that we need to give to the model to get
13:11
some output is what we call our features
13:13
so in the example where we're trying to
13:14
predict midterm 2 and let's just do this
13:17
and highlight this in red so we
13:19
understand
13:20
what we would have as our features our
13:22
input information are going to be
13:24
midterm one and final because this is
13:26
the information we are going to use to
13:29
predict something it is the input it is
13:31
what we need to give the model and if
13:33
we're training a model to look at
13:34
midterm 1 and final grade whenever we
13:36
want to make a new prediction we need to
13:38
have that information to do so now
13:40
what's highlighted in red so this
13:42
midterm 2 here is what we would call the
13:44
label or the output now the label is
13:48
simply what we are trying to look for or
13:50
predict so when we talk about features
13:52
versus labels features is our input
13:54
information the information that we have
13:56
that we need to use to make a prediction
13:58
and our label is that output information
14:00
that is just representing you know what
14:02
we're looking for
14:03
so when we feed our features to a model
14:06
it will give to us a label and that is
14:08
kind of the point that we need to
14:09
understand so that was the basic here
14:11
and now I'm just gonna talk a little bit
14:13
more about data because we will get into
14:15
this more as we continue going and about
14:17
the importance of it so the reason why
14:19
data is so important as this is kind of
14:21
the key thing that we use to create
14:24
models so whenever we're doing AI and
14:26
machine learning we need data pretty
14:29
much unless you're doing a very specific
14:30
type of machine learning and artificial
14:32
intelligence which we'll talk about
14:33
later
14:34
now for most of these models we need
14:35
tons of different data we need tons of
14:38
different examples and that's because we
14:40
know how machine learning works now
14:41
which is essentially we're trying to
14:43
come up with rules for a data set we
14:46
have some input information we have some
14:47
output information or some features and
14:49
some labels we can give that to a model
14:52
and tell it to start training and what
14:53
it will do is come up with rules such
14:56
that we can just give some features to
14:57
the model in the future and then it
14:59
should be able to give us a pretty good
15:01
estimate of what the output should be so
15:04
when we're training we have a set of
15:06
training data and that is data where we
15:08
have all of the features and all of the
15:11
labels so we have all of this
15:12
information then when we're gonna test
15:15
the model or use the model later on we
15:17
would not have this midterm to
15:18
information we wouldn't pass this in the
15:20
model we would just pass our features
15:22
which is midterm 1 and final and then we
15:24
would get the output of midterm 2 so I
15:27
hope that makes sense that just means
15:28
data is extremely important if we're
15:30
