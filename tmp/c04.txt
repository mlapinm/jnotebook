###### Table 1-3 Summary: Same-Layer and Adjacent-Layer Interactions
__|__
--|--
Concept | Description Same-layer interaction on different computers | The two computers use a protocol to communicate with the same layer on another computer. The protocol defines a header that communicates what each computer wants to do.
Adjacent-layer interaction on the same computer | On a single computer, one lower layer provides a service to the layer just above. The software or hardware that implements the higher layer requests that the next lower layer perform the needed function.

__|__|__
--|--|--
Field | Bytes | Description
Preamble | 7 | Synchronization.
Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) | 1 | Signifies that the next byte begins the Destination MAC Address field.
Destination MAC Address | 6 | Identifies the intended recipient of this frame.
Source MAC Address | 6 | Identifies the sender of this frame.
Type | 2 | Defines the type of protocol listed inside the frame; today, most likely identifies IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6).
Data and Pad* | 46– 1500 | Holds data from a higher layer, typically an L3PDU (usually an IPv4 or IPv6 packet). The sender adds padding to meet the minimum length requirement for this field (46 bytes).
Frame Check Sequence (FCS) | 4 | Provides a method for the receiving NIC to determine whether the frame   experienced transmission errors.

###### Table 2-7 LAN MAC Address Terminology and Features
__|__
--|--
LAN Addressing Term or Feature| Description 
MAC | Media Access Control. 802.3 (Ethernet) defines the MAC sublayer of IEEE Ethernet.
Ethernet address, NIC address, LAN address | Other names often used instead of MAC address. These terms describe the 6-byte address of the LAN interface card.
Burned-in address | The 6-byte address assigned by the vendor making the card.
Unicast address | A term for a MAC address that represents a single LAN interface.
Broadcast address | An address that means “all devices that reside on this LAN right now.”
Multicast address | On Ethernet, a multicast address implies some subset of all devices currently on the   Ethernet LAN.

###### Table 3-2 Different Names for a Leased Line
__|__
--|--
Name | Meaning or Reference
Leased circuit, Circuit | The words line and circuit are often used as synonyms in telco terminology; circuit makes reference to the electrical circuit between the two endpoints.
Serial link, Serial line | The words link and line are also often used as synonyms. Serial in this case refers to the fact that the bits flow serially and that routers use serial interfaces.
Point-to-point link, Point-topoint line |  These terms refer to the fact that the topology stretches between two points, and two points only. (Some older leased lines allowed more than two
devices.)
T1 | This specific type of leased line transmits data at 1.544 megabits per second (1.544 Mbps).
WAN link, Link | Both of these terms are very general, with no reference to any specific technology.
Private line | This term refers to the fact that the data sent over the line cannot be copied by other telco customers, so the data is private.

Flag | Preamble, SFD | Lists a recognizable bit pattern so that the receiving nodes realize that a new frame is arriving.
Address | Destination Address | Identifies the destination device.
Control | N/A | Mostly used for purposes no longer in use today for links between routers.
Type Type Identifies the type of Layer 3 packet encapsulated inside the frame.
FCS | FCS | Identifies a field used by the error detection process. (It is the only trailer field in this table.)

spanning-tree (vlan vlan-number) root primary | Global configuration command that changes this switch to the root switch. The switch’s priority is changed to the lower of either 24,576 or 4096 less than the priority of the current root bridge when the command was issued.
spanning-tree (vlan vlan-number) root secondary | Global configuration command that sets this switch’s STP base priority to 28,672.
spanning-tree vlan vlan-id priority priority | Global configuration command that changes the bridge priority of this switch for the specified VLAN.
spanning-tree (vlan vlan-number) cost cost | Interface subcommand that changes the STP cost to the configured value.
spanning-tree (vlan vlan-number) port-priority priority | Interface subcommand that changes the STP port priority in that VLAN (0 to 240, in increments of 16).
channel-group channel-groupnumber mode {auto  desirable  active passive  on} | Interface subcommand that enables EtherChannel on the interface.

###### Table 15-2 Interface Status Codes and Their Meanings
__|__|__
--|--|--
Name | Location | General Meaning
Line status  | First status code | Refers to the Layer 1 status. (For example, is the cable installed, is it the right/wrong cable, is the device on the other end powered on?)
Protocol status | Second status code | Refers generally to the Layer 2 status. It is always down if the line status is down. If the line status is up, a protocol status of down is usually caused by a mismatched data-link layer configuration.
  
Table end.
###### Table 15-3 Typical Combinations of Interface Status Codes
__|__|__
--|--|--
Line Status | Protocol Status | Typical Reasons
Administratively down | Down | The interface has a shutdown command configured on it.
Down | Down | The interface is not shutdown, but the physical layer has a problem. For example, no cable has been attached to the interface, or with Ethernet, the switch interface on the other end of the cable is shut down, or the switch is powered off, or the devices on the ends of the cable use a different transmission speed.
Up | Down | Almost always refers to data-link layer problems, most often configuration problems. For example, serial links have this combination when one router was configured to use PPP and the other defaults to use HDLC.
Up | Up | Layer 1 and Layer 2 of this interface are functioning.

OSPFv3 (OSPF version 3) | RFC | The OSPF you have worked with for IPv4 is actually
OSPF version 2, so the new version for IPv6 is OSPFv3.
EIGRPv6 (EIGRP for IPv6) | Cisco | Cisco owns the rights to the EIGRP protocol, but Cisco also now publishes EIGRP as an informational RFC.
MP BGP-4 (Multiprotocol BGP version 4) | RFC | BGP version 4 was created to be highly extendable; IPv6 support was added to BGP version 4 through one such enhancement, MP BGP-4.
