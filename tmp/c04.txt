Thanks 
first let me tell you a little bit about the job 
we're looking for someone to sell our new software product internationally 
the job requires flexibility independence and most importantly a pleasant manner with customers 
I agree that's important 
I've worked in sales for years and have always tried to really listen to my customers to find out what they need 
I think I'm really good at that 
that's great 
so tell me a little bit about your experience with software programs 
well I've trained people how to use a similar software product for the past two years at my current job 
so I really feel I know the product and customer needs 
hmm interesting and your sales experience
I've been with my present company for three years and in my present position since last year 
in that time I've been named salesperson of the month three
times and have taken top sales Awards several times as well 
impressive 
I'm also taking graduate courses right now in marketing 
I feel it really helps me understand the market better especially the competition

Thanks
hey what about your job 
your boss was transferred to the Asian office 
are you going to get promoted 
I might 
I might not 
no big deal 
huh I've been thinking lately 
I don't plan on working my whole life 
someday maybe in five years or so
I'm going to quit my job and get out of this stressful life 
you know relax have some fun 
Oh what are you planning to do
I'm definitely going to travel 
I might even move to another country 
maybe work is a volunteer 
I could even start a new career 
maybe one where I can help people or out the world 
what about you 
what are your plans 
well I've pretty much got everything planned already 
right up to my retirement 
really 
yep 
I'm going to work hard and save as much money as possible until I'm about 30 31 
then I'm going to become the vice president of finance 
and then the CEO by the time I'm 40 
maybe 45 
yeah 
yep 
and when I'm 35 or 36 
I'm going to settle down get married and have some kids 
oh you are you
you know that for a fact 
well it's not a fact yet 
but really if you want to succeed 
you need to have clear-cut well-defined goals and aspirations 
I don't know 
I think you should keep your options open 
you know go with the flow 
go with the flow 
OK 
so you're not nervous about the promotion 
I didn't say that 
it just won't be the end of the world if I don't get it
what about you 
are you nervous about the new job 
not really 
I'm just going to go with the flow as knowing as the flow follows my plan
I can't believe how hot it is out there
why din't we go to Hawaii with everyone else 
because we didn't have the money
wellwhy didn't we get an air-conditioner 
hello
same reason
and quit complaining 
we've got air conditioning 
Mike that's a bowl of ice and a fan 
Takeshi you've got to be more like me 
and use your imagination then you too 
can have a beach vacation 
see 
check out that gorgeous view 
right but not exactly realistic 
okay 
come over here 
close your eyes 
feel that cool ocean breeze 
Mike, that's the fridge 
come on 
I said use your imagination now close your eyes listen to the sound of the seagulls here the
children laughing 
why I think I can even smell a barbecue hot dogs
don't worry 
I'm gonna cook him up on
that grill over there 
Mike you know you're not allowed to use a grill inside an apartment right 
okay ah I'll use the microwave 
a beach with a microwave
sure like 
that's the beauty of imaginary beach 
we've got a microwave oven we've got a TV with a remote control 
who could ask for anything more
what about water 
that's the main reason people go to the beach 
what do you use for that 
the bathtub 
no that would be silly
here we go 
feel the ocean mist

you know the sound of the waves the ocean mist 
makes me want to surf 
Mike no

huh 
I'm getting the hang of this imagination thing 
very funny 
very funny indeed
[Music]
so what are today's headlines 
I don't know I'm reading the important stuff
like my horoscope in the entertainment section 
hey look at this
James Hammond is playing at CBGB's tonight 
James Hammond isn't he that famous blues guitarist 
the guy with the silver guitar and the long black hair 
no that's Kevin Diamond 
James Hammond is the singer 
his short spiky hair 
and he always worth that really cool white suit
I know him 
he's great 
let's go 
oh man
it's sold out 
oh hey look 
that's Anna
Anna Markovic 
what 
over there 
the one sitting down 
wearing the pink shirt 
no a really pretty one with the long hair and glasses
you know her 
she was in our building
she's a journalist 
she writes all the music reviews for The Village Voice 
well what are you waiting for 
go over there
go ask her if she can get us some tickets for tonight 
are you kidding 
I can't do that 
I hardly know her 
well maybe  I can 
do you ever get them up here
sometimes I go
hi Anna 
how are you 
oh hi Takeshi 
I'm great 
what's up 
not much 
so you're still writing for The Village Voice 
yeah a dedicated music reviewer
that's me 
as a matter of fact 
I'm reviewing the show tonight 
James Hammond
James Hammond I love him 
my roommate and I were just talking about how much we'd like to see that show 
really 
actually I've got two tickets 
two tickets 
that'd be great 
terrific it's a date 
you  and I can go together 
meet me outside our building at 7:00 okay 
okay 
see you then 
see you tonight 
bye
well did she have any tickets 
yeah 
we're leaving at 7:00 
fantastic man 
we're not going to have a lot of time 
we gotta go pay my share like 
I meant ana and I are leaving at 7:00 
somehow  I got a ticket and a date with Ana Markovic 
you're kidding me 
that's great 
you don't mind if I go without you 
no don't worry about it 
there's plenty of concerts but there's only one Anna Markavitch 
besides I have more important things to do
[Music]
Tara are you still reading the personal ads 
yep 
you know those ads will never help you find a relationship 
yes they will
I've already been on three dates 
yeah and you're still looking 
well it's just that I haven't found the right person yet 
I don't get it 
you've been on three unsuccessful dates 
and you still think it's a good idea 
why 
well for one thing I wouldn't say all my dates have been completely unsuccessful 
I may not have met mr. Right yet 
but I've still had fun
yeah but you can have fun anywhere 
you don't need to go searching through a newspaper for mr. Right 
Son-I it can happen 
my friend Karen just got engaged to a man she met through the personals
and she dated lots of men before she met him 
and that means 
never give up
ooh his one 
romantic handsome 
well-built male looking for attractive female for casual dating 
he's probably a total Romeo 
romantic casual dating 
there's no way he's sincere 
stop it 
hey here's one 
are you attracted to intelligence
do you enjoy a good personality 
our good looks important that looks aren't everything 
hmm good personality looks aren't everything 
sounds like he might not be too cute 
why do you say that
you've never even met him 
well first of all 
he's writing about his good personality and intelligence 
and second of all 
he's saying that look shouldn't be important for the person he dates 
which probably means he is not that attractive 
you are so fussy 
no wonder you haven't tried dating through the personals yet 
if you must know I did answer a personal ad once 
yeah 
what happened
we went out for dinner and all he did was talk about himself and his old girlfriend 
oh it was awful 
okay that does sound terrible but they're not all bad 
hmm maybe you're right 
let's see what else do you have here 
here's one 
intelligent female seeks interesting Sunday afternoon activity other than sitting at home reading silly personals 
really into Brad Pitt 
feels like seeing his new movie 
alright let's go 
what time are your new boss and her husband getting here 
any minute now
oh I'm so nervous 
Roberto here 
have some soda 
And for heaven's sake relax
entertaining people from the office is fun 
I know I know but not when it's my new boss 
I don't know her very well yet
and I just don't want to do anything rude or disrespectful 
why would you do anything like that 
just be yourself and everything will be great 
I hope so 
now where should I tell them to sit 
well it's customary to seat the most important guests at the head of a table
right there
got it 
and remember it's appropriate to offer your guests a drink when they arrive
be sure to offer both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks so they can choose
a drink right 
right 
and then you know even to the conversation before talking about work start with a bit of small talk just to get things going 
okay 
and after everyone's more comfortable 
you can talk about other things like what's going to happen when you start working in your new position 
so is it alright to talk about work while we're having dinner or should I wait until after
better wait until after dinner 
maybe during dessert 
and think before you speak
don't say anything inappropriate like you did last time
I've never said anything inappropriate
at least not to anyone at work 
remember the sales conference last year when we told that guy how much you hated the speaker and it was his wife 
oh yeah that was bad 
oh my gosh
they're here 
hmm would you relax
everything is going to be fine 
just be yourself 
right be myself 
have fun be relaxed 
got it excuse me little too much
soda honey mr. mrs. Sanderson how nice
to see you do come in by the way Mike

oh I hope I get that good someday you

you been playing the guitar I've been
playing since I was a teenager but I've
only really been studying it seriously
for about a year
how long did you say you've been playing
the flute well like I said I took
lessons when I was a kid but I hated it
I started playing about two months ago
and I'm really enjoying it this time but
like I told you I'm not very good yet
well have you been practicing practice
makes perfect
yeah I practice sometimes but I have
trouble doing it at home Tara and son
here both been studying a lot lately and
they keep telling me they need peace and
quiet so there's nowhere for me to
practice well don't worry that's what
we're going to do today and remember you
can always come and play here okay
ready to try one sure let's see how
about this one ah that looks a little
difficult okay let's see have you ever
played this one uh nope I've never
played it and probably never will it
looks a little tough hmm do you know
this one that one yeah
yeah I know it but can i play it hey I
do have one I've been practicing lately
huh this one okay why if you haven't
played it in years it was one of my
favorites shall we ah Oh what I do
[Music]
[Laughter]
we're conducting a survey of opinions
about city living do you have a couple
of minutes to answer a few questions
sure why not
great this won't take long question
number one do you agree disagree or have
no opinion about each of the following
statements there's too much noise
pollution in New York I agree okay next
rush hour in the city has become
unbearable
I totally agree I mean traffic's been an
issue here for years but recently it's
gotten a lot worse with all the
construction going on I walk to school
so it's not an issue for me so no
opinion I guess okay now just a few more
questions what do you like most about
living in New York that's easy
the restaurants there are so many of
them Mexican Japanese Indian and Thai
how about you I like the fact that there
are so many opportunities in New York if
you work hard and push yourself you
definitely can succeed here that's true
but it goes the other way too like if
you make a mistake for a hundred people
take your plates yeah but if you're
really Talent okay okay thank you
next is there anything you don't like
about living in New York where do I
start there's not enough parking there
aren't enough affordable apartments too
many people and they can be so rude mom
I totally disagree it's not that bad the
truth is the biggest problem is there's
not enough time to enjoy everything the
city has to offer you can get there in
this traffic that's not all there are so
many beautiful buildings interesting
places but there are a lot of problems
sharing New York well yeah but it can
get expensive you know so all this time
you've been pretending yet you liked it
here where's she going
I don't know but see I told you New
Yorkers were rude or not well that
nothing looks official what is it do you
remember how I told you guys that my
uncle died two weeks ago yeah I was
really sorry to hear about him he was
the one that you used to hang out with
when you were a kid back in Minnesota
the guy who lived on that little phone
right yeah well apparently his farm
wasn't so little I just got a letter
from his lawyer today
it seems that uncle max owned all of the
land in the area and he left it all to
me in as well guys I'm rich you're
kidding you uncle max was rich yeah but
I never knew it what I never knew he was
rich when I was a kid uncle max lived a
really simple life it wasn't like he was
penniless or anything nothing luxurious
he had his farm his old truck and that
was it
Wow so what happened did he strike it
rich or something no but he always used
to tell me Mickey that was his nickname
for me Mickey all a man needs is a lot
of good land and a strong back to work
it so I guess he must have just worked
hard or maybe he invested in his land I
don't know whatever he did it paid off
and you say he didn't have a really
lavish lifestyle you know like swimming
pools for his cows or something no he
never seemed to spend any money at all I
mean he was always generous with me
offered to give me spending money even
wanted me to go to private school but I
said no I thought he was just being nice
last year he called me to see if I
wanted to vacation at his summer house
ah I thought he was just joking turns
out he's got one in Europe Mike how
could you not have known I'm telling you
this guy never spent money on anything
he never bought anything that wasn't on
sale he used to have a timer by his
phone so that people wouldn't talk too
long guys
he would bring home all of the sugar and
ketchup packets every time he went to a
restaurant Wow and no one knew I didn't
in fact I used to offer to give him
money when I could you know wonder he
laughed at me who would have thought he
was that well-off who's well Mike he's
rich he's on collecting loads of cash
yeah right
and maybe you can pay for dinner tonight
that's a great idea I think I'll do that
I'll take you all out to a nice dinner
my treat um Takeshi I'm a little short
on cash until uncle Max's money comes do
you think I could borrow some I'm good
for it and we're talking a nice dinner
hi there this is Mary from VIP STV today
