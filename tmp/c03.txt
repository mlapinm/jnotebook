my parents agreed 
they let him come to Australia to study

hello. I'm Anne
come in, Ann
what a beautiful house
it's been a lot of work
but we're getting there
this is the bathroom
this is my daughter's bedroom
and here's the kitchen
and here are you've met my daughter, Louise
hello, Louise
I'm helping
yes, I see 
and my husband Mark
hello again 
oh. sorry about my heavy bag 
just kidding
but you haven't met my little brother
this is Steve
I was gonna pick you up this morning
you wouldn't let me
I'm sorry
I'd like to find my own way around 
no worries
maybe another time
yes, maybe 
come on
let's go outside 
so Anne have you been to an Australian home before
no never
it's a beautiful home Sarah 
so big. the rooms are much bigger than at home
there's more space here 
do you live in a house 
no Steve
she lives in an igloo
actually, no 
we live in an apartment 
most people do 
Singapore is much busier than Adelaide and more crowded 
yeah, and more exciting 
it's so boring here 
it's quieter 
some people like that
I don't think it's boring 
Adelaide is a very beautiful city
it's a better place to live than anywhere else I've been 
but you haven't been anywhere 
Mark hates traveling
I love it 
I just don't see the point of it
what about you, Steve
do you like to travel
yes, yeah. I've been to Kuala Lumpur and into Bali 
Bali's great
I've been to the zoo
I think you're lucky
I haven't been to the zoo
I'd love to go to the zoo
I'll take you
[Applause]
I'm sorry about my brother 
not at all
you have a lovely family 
everyone seems so happy
Anne. what's the matter 
there's something I haven't told you 
what is it
when I met your brother
I was thinking about my brother, David
I haven't seen him in two years 
how come
he's missing 
one reason I came to Australia to find him
I'm so sorry
have you had any luck
yep. I've hired a private investigator 
goodness
do you think he'll find him 
perhaps
I don't know 
it's been a long time since David last called
what do you think's happened to him
have you any idea
I really don't know
I can't help thinking the worst
I'm sure
he's alright 
if something bad had happened you would have heard 
I guess so
I suppose you're right
can I help you find your brother
oh, you're very kind
but it's not your problem
I want to help
what can I do
well, maybe you could get some copies made of this photograph
sure. sure. I'd love to. anything. he's very good looking 
such a nice smile
is he tall 
he little
he looks very fit
does he play a lot of sport
no, he used to
what does he do
is he a student
he's not really academic
he's clever 
but he prefers to do things with his hands
he sounds nice
I'm looking forward to meeting him 
come in, Anne 
good morning
good morning, are you feeling better today 
yes. thank you
what's on the agenda
I'm thinking about this trip to the wineries
I want to meet your main suppliers and talk to them about the market 
great
they've been dying to meet you
when do you want to go 
as soon as possible
how about tomorrow
I can't tomorrow
I've got some other appointments
what about the day after tomorrow
yes, that's good
it's Monday today. so that would be Wednesday
what date is that 
the fifth of November
okay. what time shall we meet
I'll pick you up at nine o'clock
good. how many wineries do you think we'll be able to see
I'm not sure, four or five 
definitely our biggest suppliers, and maybe a few surprises
I can't wait
will it take all day 
most of the day
I'll start ringing now 
and let them know we have a very important client all the way from Singapore
thank you. I'm looking forward to it
me too
Medina Hotel. Marie speeking. How may help you 
can speak to mrs. Anne Lee, please 
I'll put you through, Sir
hello
hello Anne
this is Steve Parker
Steve Parker
Steve a Sarah's brother
Oh, Steve. hello Steve
hi what are you doing
Oh, working. I'm planning a trip to the wineries later in the week
Oh. when are you going 
ah, Wednesday 
oh, good
what are you doing tomorrow
nothing. why.
well, I have the day off and I was just wondering whether you want to go to a wildlife park with me
you said you'd  like to go to the zoo
that's right, I did
yes, thank you Steve
I'd love to go 
all right
I'll meet you in the foyer 
10 o'clock
okay, 10. I'll see you then 
great. 
good night, Anne
good night, Steve
I'm sorry to hear your brother's gone missing, Miss Lee
we're all so worried
I've come to Adelaide to look for him 
how long did he study here
I'm not sure 
two semesters 
did he get good grades
I'm afraid not
I don't think computer science was the right direction for him 
the investigator mr. Barbour said you have a letter from David
of course
it's addressed to you
I told him I'd only give it to you in person
dear Anne, please don't look for me I need to be by myself
I can't study anymore
tell mom and dad to forget about me and take care of themselves
you too. look after yourself 
I'm sorry
love, your brother David 
here
I don't know what to do 
I think you should go to the police
but he says I shouldn't look for him
yes, well he might have felt that way then 
but a years a long time
if I were you I'd report your brother missing
should I tell my parents about the letter
your poor parents, they must be so worried
I think you should tell them what you know 
what if I can't find him
have faith. I'm sure you will. you know your brother 
you'll find him
I'll show you out 
well good luck ms. Lee
I don't know what else to do
why don't you advertise in a newspaper 
put a photograph of your brother there 
somebody might recognize him
good I hadn't thought of that 
my advice is, never give up
thank you for your help
when you find your brother 
say hello to him for me
I will 
these are our whites
why don't you try the Chardonnay first
it's our best-selling wine
lovely 
good fruit. perhaps a little immature
yes, it's made from some of our youngest vines 
it is our most popular white at the moment 
try this Riesling
it's very pale, isn't it 
a lot of our customers are finding it very attractive
it's a bit too dry for our market
I think we'll leave that one
but I like the Chardonnay
I think we can sell that 
excellent
let's try the reds 
our Reds are as good as any you'll find around here
what have we got here 
this is our Cabernet Sauvignon
it's very popular 
a bit too much fruit at this stage
I understand it wasn't a good year for Cabernet in this district
you know your wines, Miss Lee
I try to be prepared
what's your best red 
this one 
our Shiraz and we think it's world-class
it's lovely color, deepest red 
what vintage is this 
it's three years old now 
it'll drink well for years yet, but you can drink it right now, too
and what's the price
well it's our most expensive wine at $50 retail
and I'll think about it
it certainly got potential, but there are a lot of wines around in this class these days 
you've got a lot of competition, Tim
that's for sure
but we can work out a special price for you if you're interested
I'm definitely interested. this is very good 
Sarah knows our requirements in pricing position
I'm sure you can work out something with her
I'm sure we can
[Music]
who's next, please
could I have some prawns, please 
fresh, frozen ar cooked
frozen, please
how much do you need 
about 500 grams, please
that'll be $10 thank you
I do thinking
[Music]
can I help you
some of these leeks 
how many love 
3 
something else 
some ginger
right there not just 
this piece, please 
OK
do you have any bean sprouts 
yes we do
how much would you like 
about 100 grams
[Music]
that be all
yes thanks
that'll be $4
Thanks
[Music]
sorry Steve
fancy running into you here
where are you off to in such a hurry
oh, nowhere
I thougt I saw someone I know
oh. where
oh, it's okay. he's gone now 
I must've made a mistake
you got time for a coffee
yeah, okay 
how about here
so what are you doing in the market
I'm cooking at your house on Friday, remember
of course, friday
that'll be great
what about you 
do you come here often
what's funny
when someone says, do you come here often
it's what we call up pick-up line
you know when someone's trying..
I know what a pick up line is
I would have picked up lighting
sorry I come here every week to buy fruit
I like fresh fruit for work 
what are we having for dinner
you'll find out on Friday 
what would you like
cappuccino
yep 
and a tea, please 
tea. no worries
do you want me to take your shopping home
I can put it in the fridge for you
no, that's okay
I have a fridge in my room at the hotel
the person you saw 
who did you think it was
that's a long story
maybe I'll tell you later
on friday
maybe 
I thought I saw David at the market 
but I didn't get a very good look and I lost him in the crowd
when was this 
just yesterday
how long since you've seen him
nearly two years
are you sure you'd recognize him now
of course. he's my brother
it's just, I'm thinking he might have changed his appearance 
if he didn't want to be found
mr. Barbour, I would recognize my brother
believe me 
of course. I'm sorry. maybe you did see him at the market
it's just you've been thinking about him a lot 
the mind plays tricks, you know 
I suppose so. maybe it wasn't him. I don't know 
is there anything that would positively identify him
jewellery, a scar, anything 
his watch. my father gave it to him
he always wears it 
can you describe it
it's an old fashioned watch. an Omega
it was our grandfather's
what's the band made of 
silver. and the watch has an inscription it says to my son Norman
that's our father's name
grandfather gave it to him 
Norman 
in Chinese
in Chinese 
he might have a neck band
I gave it to him as a going-away present
what's it like 
it's made of tortoise-shell
it's a disc with a design 
like this
ah, yin yang
that's right. you know it 
the band is made of leather 
he said he'd always wear it 
yes, well it's not much, but it's something I suppose
I'll call you next week with some news
I hope so
excuse me
I have an appointment to see dr. Chang at 2:30 
and your name 
Lee Anne
ms. Lee. yes, please take a seat 
doctor will see you soon
thank you 
Miss Lee 
doctor will see you now
thank you 
so Ms. Lee.
how can I help you
I've been getting some very bad headaches lately
and I feel tense 
when do you get them
usually at night, but sometimes in the morning, too
and have you been taking anything for them
no 
you look tense
are you working too hard 
not really
I'm over here from Singapore buying wines
but something's worrying you
am I right
yes. I'm worried about my brother
he's been missing for two years
no wonder you've been getting headaches
but just let me give you a check-up to make sure it's nothing else
your blood pressure is a little high
but your heart is fine
I'm sure it's the worry about your brother
that's causing the headaches
what can I do 
try to relax and get some rest
do you prefer Western or Chinese medicine
I prefer Chinese medicine
here are some tablets 
take two, three times a day
and try not to worry about your brother
I'm sure you'll find him soon
thank you
I hope so 
are you feeling better now 
yes. the doctor said I should relax
why don't you sit down
let me cook
no. I enjoy cooking 
it is relaxing for me
okay then 
well, let me help 
what do you need
I need a sharp knife
the knives are in this drawer 
and a wok
do you have one
yes of course. it's in this cupboard
and you have a
I don't know what it's called a kind of a saucepan with holes in it
a colander. It's in here too
it's behind the saucepan 
and I'll need a bowl 
lage or small 
big enough to hold these prawns 
Oh yum, prawns. I love prawns 
How about this one
no that's too big
I don't need one as big as that
this one 
that's perfect 
okay
I'm ready
what are we having 
Singapore noodles with prawns
it's a very famous dish
you can buy it at street stalls everywhere
I hope you like it
I'm sure we will
so, what do we do first
first we have to peel the prowns
oh okay. I'll do that 
now what 
now we'll fry the prawns
the oil must be very hot
it doesn't take very long
while I'm doing that, you can chop the leeks. chop them very fine 
like this
yes. sort of
now what
next we add the spices, and some ginger 
and the leeks
okay, and now
now the lakes are soft, we put in some bean sprouts
and then the prawns 
and the noodles 
all in together
is that all
almost 
lastly we add kind of this special sauce 
I didn't think I'd be able to find this here
your markets very good 
that's it
we're almost ready
I hope your family's hungry
that was delicious Anne 
I'm glad you enjoyed it
yes, it was very tasty
if you went to Singapore you could have it every day
there you are, Mark, the advantages of travel
I thought it was absolutely superb
thank you, Steve
what did you think Louise 
too hot
I'm sorry 
that's how we ate in Singapore 
do you want play darts 
what's that 
come on, I'll show you 
can I play, too 
no in ways. let Anne relax 
she cooked dinner, so we'll clean up
you have to hold it like this 
gently, like this
look where you want the dart to go, and throw it, but not too hard 
that's pretty good for a beginner
Anne, you seem sad again
what's the matter 
there's something I haven't told you 
this is your brother
yes. I know this man
you know him 
I'm sure it's him
this is man who works at the stall where I buy fruit 
I knew it
I knew it was him 
we must go there now 
hold on
hold on
it's 10 o'clock at night 
the markets closed
let me have another look 
how long since you seen him 
two years 
it's him
I'm sure it's him
what's going on 
Steve says he knows my brother
well, I think so
he says David's working at the market
that's right 
my brother sells fruit for a living
Steve, are you sure
yes, Anne thinks she saw him 
well the markets are open tomorrow
let's find out
I can't believe it

we were driving there when you pulled us over
yes, well, you hear a lot of stories in this job
I haven't heard that one before
but it's true
I'm really sorry. it's all my fault
I was only thinking about my brother, and now you're in trouble 
it's okay, Anne
it was fault we were going too fast

[Music]

I'm so glad you're alright
I've been so worried 
Rose. this is my sister, Anne

he's beautiful 
David, why don't you tell me about Rose

Sarah, Steve
this is my brother David and his partner, Rose

[Music]
what happened 
why did you stop writing
I started my course at University 
it was very difficult 
computer science isn't for me
did you fail your exams
yes. I let everyone down.
I just wanted to die
dad must be so angry
he's just worried about you, David
I didn't know what to do
I was so confused
I had to find a job. I couldn't use father's money anymore
so I applied for a job at the markets
Phil was very kind 
he agreed to give me a job if I could get a working visa
how did you
I went home and applied for it 
you mean you went back to Singapore
yes. I was too ashamed to say anyone
I'm such a failure
I don't think you're a failure 
anyway I returned here and I started work
I met Rose, we moved in together and, well, then Sam came along
it's an amazing story
I think it's wonderful 
mum and dad won't think it's that wonderful
they'll be so relieved you're safe. 
we didn't know what to think, David 
can't I just disappear
you can pretend I don't exist 
you should have told me
I could have helped. didn't you realize we'd come and look for you 
I just couldn't face Dad 
you could have told your sister
I ought have trusted you, Anne
I'm so sorry
he's so beautiful, David. you can't keep him from mum and dad 
they're flesh and blood, David 
they're Sam's grandparents
don't you think they'll want to see him

Roses is right David
