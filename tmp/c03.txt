I love the way it sounds 
it's fine 
I'm keeping you from your work, aren't I  
I'm sorry 
I'd love to talk, but I really have to get this done right away 
I understand
you're not from here, are you
excuse me 
your accent. you come from France, don't you 
yes. the Paris, actually
that's nice. it sure is a beautiful day, isn't it 
can I have that information 
I'm not quite done 
what's taking so long
[Music]
mrs. Beatty I can take you to mr. Evans office 
he'll be here shortly 
why, thank you
beautiful day, isn't it 
yes, it is
Paul, we have our first group from India coming next week 
since mr. Rashid has travelled to India many times, I've asked him to talk to you about etiquette in India 
mr. Rashid 
Paul, why don't you greet me as if I were an Indian tourists
asked me to come with you and show me to the tour bus 
okay, hi, there. I'm Paul 
if I were an Indian woman, you would have just insulted me
women and men generally do not touch
okay. hi, there. 
you just told me to go away 
oh, I'm sorry
oh, too close
you should stand this far away from someone 
instead of shaking hands, do this and say namaste 
namaste
excellent 
now tell me to come with you to the tour bus 
okay. come with me
this is a good gesture in India 
do it like this 
come with me 
good to the bus over there 
I know I've just insulted you
pointing with your fingers is considered impolite 
use your chin instead 
to the bus over there 
I'm never gonna get this 
you're doing wonderfully
oh, thank you, mr. Rashid 
oh, to close
let's get miss Novak's tickets ready 
she may be stopping by this afternoon 
Paul, are you okay 
no. I feel awful
what's wrong 
I've got this horrible cold
I'm sneezing, my back is killing me
I've got this pain at my hip 
my neck's been bothering me all day 
and I have a stomachache 
you may have to go see a doctor 
no. I hate doctors 
I wonder what could be wrong 
maybe he's allergic to work 
I'm not kidding here 
I'm in pain 
I used to want to be a doctor, you know 
say ah
now I remember why I didn't become a doctor
Paul, you really must get some medical help
a little acupuncture might help you feel better 
stay away from me
dr. Anderson is meeting mr. Evans downstairs in the cafe 
should we ask her to come up 
she may be able to help 
great idea 
I'll go get her
you might prefer an herbal remedy 
stop it
how long have you been feeling this way
I got the cold last night, and the pain in my back started this morning 
want to try a little spiritual healing 
you're making me laugh
laughter is the best medicine, you know 
but it hurts
say ah 
cover your face, doc 
well, you have a cold, that's for sure 
what about the other stuff 
the pain in the back and the side 
have you taken any medications lately 
just some over-the-counter stuff painkiller, cold tablets, nasal spray 
that sounds okay 
and some cough medicine, vitamins, antacid 
that's a lot of medicine 
and some decongestant 
that's too much medicine in one day 
that must be why you're feeling so bad 
have you been around anyone else who's sick 
my friend Don had a cold all week 
we lifted weights last night for about an hour ran five miles 
he had to walk the last mile 
it's that your usual exercise routine 
yep
I started it yesterday
well, that explains it 
you exercise too much 
that's all 
that's all 
a little chiropractic treatment might help you
stay away from me 
now about the travel documents for the Australian group 
we've had everything mailed to them, right
mr. Evans, we gave you the package of travel documents 
to give to mr. Wells the other night at dinner, before we flew home to Sydney 
a white envelope about this big 
yes 
I gave it to mr. Rashid before he left for Lebanon 
Oh, mr. Wells needs those documents the day after tomorrow 
the group is flying in on Thursday 
I'll call the courier 
if they can pick up a package by 5:00 p.m. we should be okay 
that gives us an hour
I'll reprint the tour information, but what about the travel guides 
I can't print 25 copies that fast
I'll call copies to go and have them reprint the travel guides 
they can't do a rush job 
call Harper's instead 
they're faster and much more reliable 
hello, National Express 
I need to get a package to Australia ASAP 
if Harper's can't make the colour copies that fast, we'll take black and white 
Bob, are you reprinting the tickets 
yep 
hello 
I need to get twenty-five color documents printed right away 
yes, it's very much a hurry 
who are you calling, mr. Evans
what's that
Oh my tailor 
your tailor
these sleeves are too long, they're driving crazy 
thank you, everyone, for fixing my mistake with mr. Wells 
now I've asked Cheryl to plan a party for his group next Friday 
and I'd like for everyone to help 
Cheryl do you have a plan 
yes, I do
Marie, I'd like to have you choose the restaurant for the party
I'd love to 
Bob, I'll let you choose the menu 
you will 
Paul, could you plan the music 
yes. good 
now, Marie, I called 10 restaurants and have them give us a price for a party room 
these two had the best prices 
the green room is a nice restaurant 
great 
that's my favorite, too
now, Bob, about the food 
I was thinking steak and potatoes 
well, the client asked for fish or chicken 
so I have the restaurant put together a menu with each 
which do you like better
I like chicken more than fish, I guess
great. chicken it is 
now, Paul 
let me guess
you have a list of music choices 
these look fine 
great. I think we're all done
you see how easy it is to plan something when we do it all together
so glad we could help
[Music]
another wonderful dinner, Cheryl 
thank you 
you're welcome
I really enjoy... cooking, actually 
when I was young I thought, I was going to be a chef 
you could be a chef 
these cookies are fantastic 
why didn't you become a chef 
my mother talked to me out of it
she thought I would always have to work at night 
she was afraid I would never meet a man and get married 
she was probably right 
if you were a chef, you wouldn't have met Bob 
how do you know
before he met you, Bob only ate fast food
it's true 
your mother must have been very happy when you and Bob got engaged
she was 
hey, you'll never guess what bob was going to be 
Cheryl 
a rock musician
basketball player
no, bob was going to be a dancer 
he was actually in the state ballet when he was young 
no kidding
you never told me this 
I could have been a great dancer 
what made you change your mind
the diet was too hard 
I had to stop eating everything chocolate cake,  fried chicken, potato chips 
I tried 
I might have been able to do it 
but then they said no more bread and butter 
bread and butter 
can you believe it
and that was the end 
Wow. Bob. I never knew 
do you enjoy watching ballet at all
I can't 
I'd like to, but as soon as the music starts, I get very, very... hungry 
what about you, mr. Evans 
what did you think you're going to be when you were younger
if I tell you, will you try not to laugh
of course 
I always thought I would have my own television program to talk about etiquette 
I didn't know you are so interested in etiquette 
I have always loved etiquette 
I think I would have made a great television etiquette teacher 
well, I think you could still do it 
it's perfect for you
really. why 
well, you're very polite, for one thing 
you always know which fork to use at a restaurant 
that's a real talent you taught me a lot about the customs of other cultures 
maybe I could still give it a try 
today's topic dinner conversation 
if your international guests look offended and are leaving the table early, you've probably chosen a topic that's taboo in their home country
find out what's acceptable and what's not...
I'm not much acceptable
coming up on international etiquette with Evans 
what do you think
amazing 
unforgettable
you have a real... talent, all right 
thank you
I don't know 
I didn't know the planning a wedding would be so hard
Marie, could you give us your opinion on a few things
I'd love to 
first how many people should we invite 
Bob wants a small wedding 
20 guests would be nice 
I want a large wedding about 300 people 
300
yesterday you said 200 
I have a lot of relatives who want to come 
then there's the location 
I always thought I'd get married in a park or at the beach 
that's so romantic 
I would like to get married indoors, where I won't get wet if it's raining
that makes sense
I prefer traditional music in the ceremony 
contemporary music 
I'd like a long ceremony and a short reception
I want a short ceremony in a huge celebration afterwards 
and I want ...a chocolate cake, I know
how are we ever going to agree on this 
don't hurt yourself
here's an idea that might work 
plan a wedding that's big enough to include all of Cheryl's family sorry Bob in the Park
on Oak Street that has that building where you can go if it rains 
you can have traditional music in the ceremony and contemporary music at the party and contemporary music at the party, and you could have two cakes at the reception one white and one chocolate
sounds okay to me 
me too 
hey 
we did it
yeah
I'm so happy 
excuse me 
thank you
oh, marie, thank you so much
you're amazing 
we couldn't have done it without you 
hi. lunchtime is over 
are you coming up to the office 
I'm too tired to go back to the office 
planning a wedding is hard work
I need a holiday 
let's make today a holiday 
well tell mr. Evans we can't come back to work 
that's a great idea
what are we celebrating 
you're getting married
how about national wedding day 
what happens on national wedding day 
I don't know 
why am I the one who has to think of everything
why don't we make it national singles day instead 
all the married people give gifts to their single friends 
No. buying gifts is hard work I want to
enjoy myself on our new holiday what
about a red day everybody wears red
clothes and there's dancing in the
street that goes on all night how about
national find a friend another cup of
coffee
nice try how about national on time damn
what happens on national on-time day
remind one another to come back to work
on time waitress so mrs. Beatty you're
looking for an exciting place for your
next vacation I usually travel to major
cities in Europe but this time I want to
go someplace different someplace away
from the city as long as it's safe how
about California the Big Sur area is
spectacular California has lots of
earthquakes doesn't it well they have
earthquakes occasionally but not very
often
but it does have earthquakes yes I'm not
going okay
how about some place in Asia a beach in
Thailand
coach Aang has beautiful beaches and
it's very quiet there a quiet beach
sounds nice but they said on the news
there's a monsoon in Thailand
and what the monsoon will be over by the
time you go what else can you recommend
Australia the Australian outback is
amazing I've heard they have tornadoes
in Australia some parts where else
Jamaica Hurricanes
South Africa floods Hawaii about natural
disasters don't you miss his baby
what about Finland Finland it's wild
beautiful and very different from other
parts of Europe and nothing bad ever
happens in Finland it sounds good I'll
go to Finland great booked your tickets
ok I just booked your tickets to
Helsinki Finland
you'll be staying at the Palace Hotel
that's great excuse me mr. Evans yes
Murray mr. Woods is on the phone he told
me to tell you it's urgent urgent he's
travelling you know yes he said there's
some kind of epidemic what kind of
epidemic it sounds like it's that new
influenza but he was vaccinated for that
before he left I know but he told me to
tell you that he wants to fly home today
on the Internet it says only three
people are sick
that is not an epidemic and it's not
like anybody's dying from this flu he
said he didn't want to be the first
where is he traveling may I ask he's in
Finland Finland just booked tickets to
Finland mrs. baby
everything will be fine you'll get
vaccinated and you'll have nothing to
worry about
I'm not going to Finland you told me
nothing bad ever happens in Finland mrs.
Beatty I can't think of anywhere in the
world you can go and be completely safe
right here in this city you could go
outside and get hit by a bus but you
can't let that stop you from doing the
things you want to do look why don't we
go to lunch and we'll talk it over
I don't think she's going anywhere
[Laughter]
hello Bob
dining alone Paul Murray went to get
newspapers do you mind if I join you oh
please sit down
may I ask what you're reading a history
of the world the bestseller I'm very
impressed
reading nonfiction over lunch I hear
that it's a very difficult book no it's
it's a pretty easy reading I can't put
it down actually a real page-turner huh
do you think that I could borrow it when
you're done
sure I usually prefer fiction myself you
know thrillers mysteries there's nothing
like curling up with a good science
fiction novel is there you read science
fiction too don't tell anyone are you
learning a lot from your book yeah I
think so so tell me what you're reading
about right now um this part is about
Great Britain really do you mind if I
take a look Cheryl hates when I read
comics that I can understand why you
can't put the book down
i thinkin I could borrow it then I'm
still reading this one but I have
another one I can loan I meant this look
at this the paper says in a tornado
carried a woman for 300 miles and she
lived to tell about I'm not sure if you
know this but that story isn't true it's
in the paper it must be true that paper
is trash I can't believe you're reading
it
what do you mean it's fiction it's not
news nothing in there is true if you
want real news you have to read this
paper that paper is boring this one's
much more interesting woman gives birth
to cow man builds house from bread baby
with two heads
come on this is offensive storm kills
100 in Texas train accident kills five
injures more man kills wife and son I'm
sorry but all that death and destruction
is pretty offensive to me I know that
these things happened and I know that
those didn't you don't know that you
just assume that it's true
let's ask Bob and mr. Evans what paper
they read never mind let's just read
that sounds good to me
look at this a man with four legs
what are those wacky glasses you're
wearing these are ultra high-tech
top-of-the-line state-of-the-art
cutting-edge TV glasses and you're
actually watching TV right now yeah
right here in the corner
what are you watching the basketball
game unbelievable and Cheryl doesn't
mind this yes sorry my team's winning
this new invention doesn't bother you
are you kidding
if I'd known how happy they would make
him I would have bought those glasses
for Bob long ago technology today is
amazing you know I wish they'd invent
something that would make people who
talk on cell phones quieter this guy in
the cafe today was so loud I couldn't
hear myself talking
what oh sorry I was laughing at this guy
on TV if I could invent something it
would be a thing for Bob's car that
would automatically charge him when he
goes over the speed limit
he drives so fast sometimes but he'd
slow down if he had to pay no is your
team losing no I heard what you said you
just leave my car alone hi Paul
wait till you see what I've got what is
it well I have this problem with my cell
phone whenever I'm traveling with a
group I can never hear it ring or feel
it vibrate so I got this thing that lets
me know whenever my phone is ringing how
does it do that it buzzes me buzzes you
know so I could feel it does it work I
don't know
then once told me in oh oh what so
what's going oh oh hello
no one's there wow that was a big buzz
it almost hurt
maybe it isn't working right it's
working fine who Oh another photo whoa
strange man if ever get used to that
I'll always know whenever my phone is
ringing if I were you I would take that
thing back to the store before you hurt
yourself
I'm going I'll see you later hopes to
drive okay he'll be fine
how do you know I'll stop calling him
did you see the politicians expect to
raise taxes again really what does the
government decide to spend our money on
now they're planning to build a stronger
military it's wrong to spend so much on
the military they should spend it on
education instead
can we please avoid discussing politics
why every time we begin talking about
politics people get mad at each other
they should spend more money on fighting
corruption if they were able to stop
corrupt officials maybe they wouldn't
need to raise our taxes that's true but
I think we need to spend more money on
the military without a strong military
the world won't be very safe that's one
way to look at it but maybe the world
would be safer and better if we try to
eliminate poverty what do you think
Cheryl I think that if I say what I
really think you'll get all mad and call
me crazy or ridiculous Cheryl don't be
so afraid we're only talking
I think that the government should spend
more money on cooking schools what most
people don't know how to cook well I
think the government should help teach
them that's ridiculous
are you crazy use our taxes to pay for
cookies of course not but look at you
you're all mad at me this is why I never
discuss politics with friends but don't
let me stop you from getting mad at each
other
Paul I never knew you are so
conservative
I'm not conservative sure you are you
always seem to want things to be just
like they used to be
that's not conservative that's just
smart
Thanks that's the definition of
conservative really well I didn't know
you were so radical what makes you think
I'm radical you always want to change
everything
no I don't I just want our government to
realize that it's the 21st century and
they need new ways of doing things
thank you that sounds radical to me Bob
tell him I'm not a radical she's not a
radical
she's a liberal like me I wouldn't call
you a liberal oh really
I'd say you're more of a moderate you're
always in the middle if I want to be a
liberal I'll be a liberal thank you
honey you can be whatever you want you
just can't be one thing and call it
something else listen to you you're like
a little dictator
I studied politics in school I know
something about the definition of
political beliefs is that so so what is
Cheryl a radical moderate conservative
who knows she's not saying Cheryl what
are you would you mind telling us that
much okay you want to know what I
believe I believe I believe I believe
these are the best chips I have ever
tasted
everyone we'd like to ask your opinion
about something
what is that we're trying to decide
where to go on vacation after the
wedding for our honeymoon we thought you
might be able to help us decide on a
location an excellent idea where are you
thinking of going well Bob doesn't
really like to travel so he's agreed to
go wherever I want to go as long as the
hotel has nice bathrooms and a TV that
sounds fair
what's your first choice I've always
wanted to go to Cozumel off the Yucatan
Peninsula
Koza Mel is spectacular the island
itself is pretty flat but the beaches
are beautiful and the ocean is so blue
aren't there so many sharks to go
swimming there no it's very safe what oh
but it's somewhat overrated
you just said what else are you thinking
of what about Tierra del Fuego in the
south of Argentina and Chile the scenery
is extraordinary the mountain ranges and
national parks are breathtaking
but in June won't it be too dark to do
very much no plenty of people go there
in June to the skiing or but of course
it's probably not romantic enough
terrible I've heard the jungles and
rainforests in Malaysia are must-see
there's so much of course some people
feel that the scorpions make it too
dangerous we could go to that Hotel on
Grant Street along the river stay in
town for our honeymoon
big television Cheryl you once told me
that you wanted to go to Tahiti that's
right I forgot about that you would love
to et one of the most beautiful places
on earth and very very romantic
really you all think Tahiti is a good
idea I think you'd love it
it's too expensive how expensive well do
you remember how much mr. Rasheed's
vacation to Tahiti cost yes I do he
traveled cheaply
oh well that's it I'm out of ideas I
guess we'll go someplace boring
we weren't going to tell you until a
couple months from now but Paul Murray
and I were talking and we thought a
vacation in the South Pacific would be
perfect I just wish we could afford it
so we decided that as our wedding gift
to you we'd like to send you to Tahiti
all expenses paid we book your flights
and a hotel on the southern coast for
two weeks but the and the hotel room has
a spectacular bathroom EB this big
[Applause]
and this one voice output vibration here
dip dip okay let's talk about how to
make the t-cell first basically remember
they are the same like the way to make
these are the same choose difference
here is voice or unvoiced vibration or
no vibration right to make this cell you
have to put your the tip of your tongue
right behind your upper teeth like this
right behind here okay and then press
your two teeth together and then make a
blows itself like a drumbeat between the
two teeth here you would feel that this
airflow is strong and dry and quick okay
