A router has EIGRP configured as the only routing protocol. How does EIGRP respond if there is no feasible successor route to a destination network and the successor route fails?
EIGRP sends a Hello packet to the DR to inform it of the route failure
It immediately sends its entire routing table to its neighbors
It automatically forwards traffic to a fallback default route until a successor route is found 
It sends queries out to neighbors until a new successor route is found

True or False: All routes used as successors must be of equal value to the same destination in order to do load balancing.
True
False v

In EIGRP, what is a feasible successor (FS) and where is it stored?
A FS is a primary route, stored in the topology table
A FS is a backup route, stored in the routing table
A FS is a primary route, stored in the routing table
A FS is a backup route, stored in the topology table v

RIPv2
IGRP
EIGRP v

Where can route summarization occur with EIGRP?
Only at a network area boundary

Anywhere in the network v
Only at the AS boundary

A router learns about a remote network from EIGRP, OSPF, and a static route. Assuming all routing protocols are using their default administrative distance, which route will the router use to forward data to the remote network?

The router will use the OSPF route
The route will use the EIGRP route
