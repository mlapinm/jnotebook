### 5 Introduction To Python Programming - Lesson Summary
### The key points from this module are: 
- The Basic principle of programming is that it is problem solving.
Python is one of the easier programming languages to learn, and many of its tools are free to download and use.
- One you learn how to code in one programming language it will be easier to learn other programming languages, as the principles are the same.
- There are a lot of different variations of Python, IronPython, Ipython, CPython to name a few. Most of python’s variations only have some syntax differences but not too many.

### Comments are very useful in your code to help you or someone else understand:

- What your program does,

- What a particular line or section of code does;

- Why you chose to do something a particular way;

- Anything that might be helpful to know if you or someone else looking at the code later and trying to understand it.

The # is the symbol to indicate using comments in python.

## MODULE 2 Displaying Text
This module will introduce you to displaying text on screen using the using the print function and how to put typed text inside quotes in the print function. You will learn about how python accepts using single, double and triple quotes to display your text and the differences in uses each of them. It is important to know that everyone makes mistakes when programming and you will be shown recommended solutions to help fix mistakes.

### After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Identify how to use the print() function to display text.
Recognize the different methods of using quotes to contain your text in the print function.
- Identify process of making mistakes in programming and different solutions to help find and resolve mistakes.

## MODULE 3 String Variables
This module will show you how to get the user to input data. You will learn about creating variables as well as the rules and guidelines for creating them, along with printing your variable on screen. Learn about combining variables and strings using the + symbol and how to manipulate your variables using built in functions as well as what functions are. You will learn about Visual Studio’s IntelliSense feature and its helpfulness for programming.
