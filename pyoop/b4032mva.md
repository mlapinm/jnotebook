### Use Python basics to solve mysteries and find answers


### Set up your Python beginner development environment with Visual Studio Code

### Crack the code and reveal a secret with Python and Visual Studio Code
### You're handed a secret message that needs a code cracker to find the truth. Learn how to solve the code mystery to reveal a location and date to find a hidden treasure. Get a glimpse into the popular Python programming language with this introductory lesson that requires no coding experience.


### Introduction to using a secret message decoder
- Write your first lines of Python code
- Create a function to decode a character by using a cipher
- Create a function to decode a word by using a cipher
- Discover the secret location to reveal the hidden treasure in this module
### Check that Visual Studio Code is ready to decode messages
### Python basics for creating a secret message decoder
### Part 1: Decode one letter at a time with a Caesar cipher
```
vs = [0,1,2,3]
dif = 2
ns = []
for v in vs:
    n = (v+dif)%4
    ns.append(n)
print(vs)
print(ns)
# [0, 1, 2, 3]
# [2, 3, 0, 1]

def lassoLetter( letter, shiftAmount=2):
    letterCode = ord(letter.lower())
    aCode = ord('a')
    letter2Code = aCode + (letterCode - aCode + shiftAmount) % 26
    return chr(letter2Code)

vs = ['a', 'b', 'y', 'z']
v2s = []
for v in vs:
    v2 = lassoLetter(v)
    v2s.append(v2)



```
### Part 2: Decode one letter with a Caesar cipher by wrapping around the English alphabet
### Decode a full word with a Caesar cipher
```
def lassoLetter( letter, shiftAmount=2):
    letterCode = ord(letter.lower())
    aCode = ord('a')
    letter2Code = aCode + (letterCode - aCode + shiftAmount) % 26
    return chr(letter2Code)

def lassoWord( word, shiftAmount=2):
    shiftWord = ''
    for letter in word:
        shiftLetter = lassoLetter(letter, shiftAmount)
        shiftWord += shiftLetter
    return shiftWord


print(lassoWord("abyz"))
# cdab

```


```
print( "Shifting Ncevy by 13 gives: \n" + lassoWord( "Ncevy", 13 ) )
print( "Shifting gpvsui by 25 gives: \n" + lassoWord( "gpvsui", 25 ) )
print( "Shifting ugflgkg by -18 gives: \n" + lassoWord( "ugflgkg", -18 ) )
print( "Shifting wjmmf by -1 gives: \n" + lassoWord( "wjmmf", -1 ) )

# Shifting Ncevy by 13 gives:
# april
# Shifting gpvsui by 25 gives:
# fourth
# Shifting ugflgkg by -18 gives:
# contoso
# Shifting wjmmf by -1 gives:
# ville
```
### Use the Lasso decoder to reveal the secret message
```
word = "April 4th in Contosoville"
print(word + " - " + lassoWord( word, 4 ) )
# Correct! When you decipher the secret message by using your code, 
# you get the answer april fourth contosoville.
```
