1
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:04,542
Oh, the... there's
a 7:15 at the ArcLight.

2
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:06,506
Well, that doesn't give
us much time to eat.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,696
We can eat afterwards.

4
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:09,632
I'm not gonna eat
at 10:00 at night.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,000
Who am I, Hemingway?

6
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:14,770
Why do you think
Hemingway ate at 10:00?

7
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,006
He spent a lot of time in
Spain. They eat dinner late.

8
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:18,841
He also spent
a lot of time in Florida.

9
00:00:18,909 --> 00:00:20,454
Last time I was there,
people were eating dinner

10
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,344
at, like, 4:30.

11
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:23,679
You guys know

12
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:26,448
that Hemingway had
cats with six toes?

13
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:30,686
Six toes per foot
or six toes total?

14
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:32,154
Okay.

15
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:34,303
It's official. We're never
going to see the <i>Avengers.</i>

16
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,892
Guys, just come on.
Make a decision.

17
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:38,494
I-I'm good with
eating after.

18
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:41,063
- Mm, I'm kind of hungry now.
- Yeah, me, too.

19
00:00:41,132 --> 00:00:42,576
- Then we'll eat before.
- Okay.

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,534
So, then, we can see the 3-D
at 9:00 or the 2-D at 9:30.

21
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:47,202
3-D.
If I'm gonna see Thor,

22
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:49,872
I want to feel like
I could lick those abs.

23
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,342
Actually,
3-D kind of makes me queasy.

24
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:54,810
No, but we have to see it
in 3-D.

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,079
We saw part one in 3-D,
and the 2-D part two

26
00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:59,148
is not the part two
of the 3-D part one.

27
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:02,451
He's got you there, Leonard.
Or he doesn't.

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,353
I don't really care anymore.

29
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:05,487
Okay, then,

30
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:06,833
- we'll go see it in 3-D.
- No.

31
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:08,869
Sweetie, you shouldn't do things
that make you feel bad.

32
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:11,327
Well, I'm doing this.

33
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:12,728
And of course he is.

34
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:14,697
He is a textbook satisficer.

35
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:16,098
That's not even a word.

36
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:17,333
Uh, yes, it is.

37
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,768
According to Nobel Prize-winning
economist Herbert Simon,

38
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:21,770
satisficing is a
decision-making strategy

39
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:23,238
whereby a person accepts

40
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:25,674
whatever available
option is satisfactory

41
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:27,187
rather than seeking out
a course of action

42
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,477
that would make him happiest,

43
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,013
as I just did when I explained
what satisficing was.

44
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,315
He's right.

45
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:34,650
No one wanted to hear at.

46
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,418
He knew it, yet
he plowed ahead.

47
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:39,455
I'm just trying to find a plan

48
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:40,756
that makes everyone happy.

49
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:42,024
Except you.

50
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:44,026
Yeah, Leonard.
What would make you happy?

51
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:46,228
I could tell you about
satisficing again.

52
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:47,507
You know,
what would make me happy

53
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,098
is if we just stop talking
about this

54
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,477
and see whatever movie
you guys want to see

55
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:51,611
whenever you want to see it.

56
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:53,438
Okay. But next time,
we get to pick.

How's your headache?

68
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:27,794
It's better.
The throwing up really helped.

69
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:31,665
Mm. I'm so sorry you missed
the end of the movie.

70
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:32,899
Oh, it's okay.

71
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:35,101
Everyone talked about it
so much on the ride home,

72
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,370
I feel like I saw it.

73
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,773
Well, to be fair, you talked
about the bathroom so much,

74
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:42,042
we felt like we saw that, too.

75
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:44,377
I think I would've been okay

76
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:45,912
if we weren't sitting so close.

77
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:47,747
Well, then,
why did we sit so close?

78
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:49,883
Sheldon said, "Are these seats
good for everyone?"

79
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:53,186
What was I supposed to do,
say no, like a maniac? -

80
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:55,422
Sweetie, you have
got to stand up for yourself.

81
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,668
You know, maybe Sheldon's right.

82
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:58,725
Maybe you are that word he said.

83
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:00,026
Satisficer?

84
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:01,261
Yeah, that!
That's the one.

85
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,997
Boy, sounds way more made-up
when you say it.

86
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:06,277
I mean, come on,
when was the last time

87
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:07,979
you did something
totally selfish without worrying

88
00:03:08,003 --> 00:03:09,147
about what anyone else wanted?

89
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:10,270
Uh...

90
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:11,604
according to my mother,

91
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:13,840
I took my sweet time being born.

92
00:03:16,912 --> 00:03:18,645
How is that selfish?

93
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:21,915
Apparently, she had
dinner reservations.

94
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:26,519
And this is the telescope room

95
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:28,955
where I spend a lot
of my evenings.

96
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:30,690
Where's the telescope?

97
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,425
Hawaii.

98
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:33,760
That's cool.

99
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,595
Yeah, so, you know...

100
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:37,097
aloha.

101
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:42,068
What's that smell?

102
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:44,204
Uh, everyone has
their own theory.

103
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:45,805
Dr. Tibourgh thinks it's mold.

104
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:47,674
I think it's Dr. Tibourgh.

105
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:50,977
So, what am I looking at?

106
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:53,413
Ah, this is live information

107
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:55,415
from the Keck telescope.
It's pretty interesting.

108
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:58,318
So, I recently observed
some optical flashes.

109
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:00,587
It could be light bouncing
off a natural object,

110
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:01,866
but those tend to
be less reflective,

111
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,857
so could be evidence of
something alien-made.

112
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,093
Oh, this suddenly got exciting.

113
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:08,895
Oh. When you say "exciting,"

114
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:10,508
do you mean "go back
to my place" exciting

115
00:04:10,532 --> 00:04:12,165
or "hold our breath
and do it here"?

116
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:17,704
Mahalo.

117
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:27,180
Do I want to ask?

118
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,183
Oh, w... when I go upstairs,

119
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:32,585
Penny's gonna make me choose
what we're gonna do tonight

120
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:34,587
without taking her feelings
into consideration,

121
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,589
and I-I don't know
if I'm up for it.

122
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:40,527
Poor baby.
When I go upstairs,

123
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,429
Sheldon's gonna give me
a 25-minute lecture

124
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:45,532
about what Hulk would be like
if he were made of metal.

125
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:48,234
Part of his ongoing series,

126
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:51,304
"What If Hulk Were Made
of Other Things?"

127
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:54,107
I-I've always been
a people pleaser.

128
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:56,643
Is that so bad?
It's gotten me this far.

129
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:59,379
What, almost up four
flights of stairs?

130
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,449
Okay, if I go in there

131
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:05,285
and pick something I want to do
that she also wants to do,

132
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:07,165
she's gonna think I'm just
picking it to make her happy.

133
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:08,688
So I feel like

134
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:10,868
I have to pick something
I know she doesn't want to do

135
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:12,132
or she's gonna be disappointed.

136
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,493
Right?
What do you think?

137
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:15,795
Think I've got ice cream
in this bag

138
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:17,130
that's starting to melt.

139
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,432
I'm sorry.

140
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:21,868
It's exhausting
being in my head.

141
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:24,504
Look, when you wanted
Penny, you didn't care

142
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:26,940
what anybody else
thought or wanted,

143
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:28,341
including Penny.

144
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:32,679
That's true.

145
00:05:32,747 --> 00:05:34,948
Yeah, yeah,
there was something I wanted,

146
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:37,684
I went after it and I got it.

147
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:40,192
Now you're hiding from it on the
stairs, so it all worked out.

148
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,457
Hey.

149
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:45,937
I thought about what
I want to do tonight,

150
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:48,728
and I didn't take your feelings
into consideration at all.

151
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:51,197
Great.

152
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:52,732
I want to have sex.

153
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:56,336
Wow, sex with your wife.

154
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:59,539
You're really swinging for
the fences there, Hofstadter.

155
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:01,274
Yeah, we don't have to.

156
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:02,475
No!

157
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:03,810
I like it.
Let's go.

158
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,278
Oh, o-okay.

159
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:06,757
And then after that,
we're gonna watch

160
00:06:06,781 --> 00:06:08,114
<i>Star Trek: Discovery.</i>
- All right.

161
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:10,950
Well, just a warning, I might be
on my phone for most of it.

162
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:12,752
That's fine.

163
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:14,165
Wait, you mean
just the <i>Star Trek...</i>

164
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:16,222
Actually, I don't care.

165
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,027
And, with apologies
to Lady Gaga,

166
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:23,563
that's how a star is born.

167
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:28,168
Told you he was
gonna mention Lady Gaga.

168
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:31,511
At least he didn't talk
about how much he cried

169
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:32,805
during that movie.

170
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:34,140
Although,

171
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,820
if you haven't seen that movie,
you should.

172
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:37,744
I cried so much.

173
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:41,214
Well, that's the lecture
for today.

174
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:43,116
Uh, let's open it up
for questions.

175
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:45,385
Uh...

176
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:47,787
Oh, you! Sir, yes.

177
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:48,922
You have a question?

178
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,791
Yeah. Actually,
I have a two-part question.

179
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,627
Are you sure? I get the sense
it's only one part.

180
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:57,263
No, no, it's two.

181
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:59,232
Part one: the new star

182
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,366
you were talking about--

183
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:02,602
how long did it take
that light to reach Earth?

184
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:03,970
And part two:

185
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:05,516
is it true you plant
your friends in the audience

186
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,607
to ask questions?

187
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:09,609
46,000 years.

188
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:11,044
And no,
I don't plant my friends,

189
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:13,479
because apparently,
I don't have any.

190
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,616
Uh, any other questions?

191
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:19,152
- Uh, yes. You, miss.
- Hi.

192
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,521
I read your paper on specular
reflections. It was great.

193
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,390
- Oh, thank you so much.
- In your conclusion,

194
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:25,792
you said you couldn't rule out
that light flashes

195
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,027
could be evidence
of alien civilization.

196
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:31,130
So does that mean
you think it's aliens?

197
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,399
I was just illustrating
that there are many unknowns,

198
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:34,867
and as scientists, we can't

199
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:36,736
preemptively rule out
possibilities.

200
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:38,838
So you think it's aliens.

201
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:41,107
- A-Actually, no, that's...
- I have a question

202
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:43,276
about the aliens you found.

203
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:45,645
That's not what I said, Howard.

204
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:47,313
Hold on a second.

205
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:50,216
Do you two know each other?

206
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:51,651
Yeah.

207
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,852
My sister was--

208
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:55,888
a-and this is her term--
abducted.

209
00:07:57,492 --> 00:08:00,560
Do you think those could be
the same aliens...

210
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:03,062
Okay, any other questions? Mm.

211
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:04,163
Not about aliens?

212
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:07,300
What?

213
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:09,213
Do you still want me to
ask the one you gave me?

214
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:11,671
'Cause it kind of feels
like we're past that.

215
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:16,542
Ooh, Leonard,
I don't mean to alarm you,

216
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:19,045
but the Chinese food
smells funny.

217
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:20,780
That's because it's barbecue.

218
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,417
But it's Chinese food night.

219
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:25,930
Um, I picked it. You're
the one who told me

220
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:28,087
to stop being such a
satisficer all the time.

221
00:08:28,156 --> 00:08:29,589
What?
I did not.

222
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:31,424
I just pointed out
that you were one.

223
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:33,693
It's what I like best about you.

224
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:36,696
Well, that and those little
notes you leave in my lunch.

225
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,033
I leave those!

226
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,069
Well, that's disappointing.

227
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:44,148
I already know
that you heart me.

228
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:46,472
Now I don't know
if Leonard does.

229
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,308
Well, this is what
we're having for dinner.

230
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,510
You can eat it or not.
I don't care.

231
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:52,612
I guess that answers
the heart question.

232
00:08:52,681 --> 00:08:55,148
I-It's fine.
We'll have barbecue.

233
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:57,784
Oh, of course.
I'm nothing if not flexible.

234
00:08:57,852 --> 00:08:59,852
I'm sure that at some point

235
00:08:59,921 --> 00:09:02,288
in the 3,000-year history
of the Chinese empire,

236
00:09:02,357 --> 00:09:04,190
a cavalryman crossing

237
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:07,126
the Gobi Desert was forced
by hunger to eat his own horse

238
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:08,272
and roast it over a campfire,

239
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:10,496
hence, Chinese barbecue.
Let's eat.

240
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,535
Gee, I'm sorry, I didn't
watch the news today.

241
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:18,104
Has the whole world gone mad?

242
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:19,839
It's my house.

243
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:22,709
I'm tired of being told
where I can and can't sit.

244
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:26,746
You did this.

245
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,715
Amy, grab your meat.
We're leaving in a huff.

246
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:33,720
I'm sorry, if I don't go now,
it's not a huff.

247
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:39,025
Don't take this the wrong way,

248
00:09:39,094 --> 00:09:41,494
but that was even more exciting
than the sex.

249
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:45,898
Don't take this the wrong way,
but yes, it was.

250
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:56,514
Leonard, where are you going?

251
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:57,747
Well, to work.

252
00:09:57,816 --> 00:09:59,349
Just trying out
a different route.

253
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:00,850
Okay.

254
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,454
If we cross the county line,
it's technically kidnapping.

255
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:07,357
Well, if you don't approve
of my driving, too bad.

256
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:08,992
This is the new me.
Get used to it.

257
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,060
Fine.
Then this is the new me,

258
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:13,229
and he finds
the new you tiresome.

259
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,733
How is that different
than the old you?

260
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:18,835
The new me gives knowing winks.

261
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:23,273
Well, all these years,

262
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:25,608
I-I was afraid to say
what I wanted.

263
00:10:25,677 --> 00:10:27,210
You know, even at work,

264
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,079
you know, there's things
I want to accomplish,

265
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:32,215
but I didn't want to ruffle any
feathers or step on any toes.

266
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:34,217
Feathers and toes?
Is the new thing you're trying

267
00:10:34,286 --> 00:10:36,953
to accomplish ballroom dancing
with a chicken?

268
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:40,023
Look at that--
the new me is hilarious.

269
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,492
Always wanted to be
the principal investigator

270
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:44,761
on a plasma physics study.

271
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,597
Hey, look at that--
the new you's funny, too.

272
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,900
I'm serious.
You know...

273
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:52,469
I'm gonna put together
a proposal

274
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:54,617
and tell President Siebert
this is what I want to do.

275
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:55,839
If he doesn't let me,

276
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:57,941
there's plenty of other
universities that will.

277
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:59,709
Sure there are.

278
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:03,947
Of course you don't
want me to do that,

279
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:05,577
because you like it when
you're successful and I'm not.

280
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,784
No, you're confusing
causation and...

281
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:10,520
"Welcome to Alhambra."
Where the heck are we?

282
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:15,391
Now I'm some sort
of big joke.

283
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,094
I'm even on some
alien conspiracy blog.

284
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:20,196
See? "Caltech
astrophysicist

285
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:22,365
finds proof of alien life''

286
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:26,202
Wow, that is not
a great picture of you.

287
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:27,770
That's not the point.

288
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,138
Dr. Koothrappali.

289
00:11:29,207 --> 00:11:31,741
I'm surprised to see you in here.
Why is that?

290
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,976
Because the truth...

291
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:34,978
is out there!

292
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:39,449
You see? That's what
I'm talking about.

293
00:11:39,518 --> 00:11:41,451
People have been doing
that to me all day.

294
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,286
Relax.
They're just having fun.

295
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,724
Oh, come on!

296
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:51,161
See? It's fun.

297
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,370
Wow. Déjà vu.

298
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:03,106
Amy, you're a neuroscientist--

299
00:12:03,174 --> 00:12:05,308
you know the latest research
into déjà vu suggests

300
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:07,610
it's nothing but
the frontal regions of the brain

301
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,712
attempting to correct
an inaccurate memory.

302
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:11,748
You telling me stuff
I already know

303
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,483
is definitely déjà vu.

304
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:16,953
How about telling me
something I don't know,

305
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:19,689
like why you're
sitting on the stairs.

306
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:22,659
How can I tell if I'm doing
something for a noble reason

307
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:24,160
or a selfish reason?

308
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:27,330
Try saying the thing
in your head

309
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,867
and see if you can add
the words, "That'll show 'em."

310
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:34,370
Leonard's about to demand a job

311
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:37,040
that I don't think
the university will give him.

312
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:39,242
I'm worried he's making
a giant mistake.

313
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:41,244
But maybe I only
think that because

314
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:44,113
deep down I don't
want him to succeed.

315
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:48,017
The fact that you're worried
about your motivation

316
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:51,521
supports the idea that you
genuinely care for your friend.

317
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:56,192
I do.

318
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:57,927
Thank you, Amy.

319
00:12:57,996 --> 00:12:59,128
You know what?

320
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:00,797
After I've talked to Leonard,

321
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:03,466
you've earned yourself
a bonus lecture on Sponge Hulk.

322
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:08,271
That'll show me.

323
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,011
So, I spent the whole day
putting together this proposal,

324
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,246
and tomorrow I'm gonna
tell President Siebert

325
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:19,415
that this is what
I want to do.

326
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:22,085
Oh. Well, this...

327
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:24,787
looks great.

328
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:27,156
- You didn't even open it.
- Well, no,

329
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,391
it's got a nice, you know,

330
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,727
science-y heft to it. I...

331
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:32,428
Really proud of
you, sweetie.

332
00:13:33,598 --> 00:13:34,797
Leonard?

333
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:36,199
- Hmm?
- Um,

334
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:37,867
I have been agonizing

335
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:40,036
over whether or not
to say something to you.

336
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:41,971
Aw. Let me help. Don't.

337
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:44,407
I have to.

338
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:47,510
I don't think that you
should demand to be in charge

339
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:48,911
of a plasma project.

340
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,079
Well, big surprise.

341
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:52,849
You can't stand the idea
of me succeeding.

342
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,350
No. I'll be honest.

343
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:57,387
New assertive Leonard is going
to take some getting used to.

344
00:13:57,455 --> 00:14:00,123
But so did
cargo pants Leonard, hmm?

345
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,091
Who, for the record,
I miss.

346
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,727
He always had gum.

347
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:07,096
Sheldon, if this is what he
wants, he should ask for it.

348
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:09,198
I mean, what's the worst
that happens? They say no.

349
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,933
Well, I'm not
gonna let them say no.

350
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:13,970
If they don't want me to quit,
this is what it's gonna take.

351
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,538
Wait, you're gonna quit?

352
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:18,174
Yeah. It's like you said,
I have to go after what I want,

353
00:14:18,243 --> 00:14:19,876
and if I can't get that
at Caltech,

354
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:21,984
there are plenty of other
universities in the world.

355
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:23,546
W... In the world?

356
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:25,415
I can't even get you
to go to the beach,

357
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,184
and now you want to
move to the world?

358
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:30,357
Well, I don't want to, but
if that's what I have to do...

359
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:31,288
Okay, don't you think

360
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:32,633
threatening to quit
your job is something

361
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,023
you should run by me first?

362
00:14:34,092 --> 00:14:36,259
You said I shouldn't
worry about your feelings.

363
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:39,028
I meant feelings about things
that I don't care about!

364
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:40,841
Now, I'm not quite sure
when to jump in here...

365
00:14:40,865 --> 00:14:42,732
- Not now.
- Okay.

366
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:45,168
Fine, you want to talk about it?
Let's talk about it.

367
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:47,170
I-I'm not loving
my job right now.

368
00:14:47,238 --> 00:14:49,119
And this is something
that would make me happy.

369
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:50,351
Don't you want me to be happy?

370
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,076
Oh, I've been dinged
on this before.

371
00:14:52,077 --> 00:14:54,811
Whatever you really think,
you have to say yes.

372
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,281
- Of course I want you to be happy.
- Well played.

373
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:01,084
Okay, I know this seems scary,

374
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:03,453
but I put together
a strong proposal.

375
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:05,855
It's good for me,
it's good for the university.

376
00:15:05,924 --> 00:15:07,757
They're gonna give it to me.

377
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:09,092
No.

378
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:12,361
I'm sorry, President Siebert,

379
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,597
but I'm not taking no
for an answer.

380
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,265
I speak a little Russian.

381
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:18,868
Will you take <i>nyet</i>
for an answer?

382
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:20,670
I'm serious.

383
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:22,872
Oh.
Well, that changes everything.

384
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:24,874
- Really?
- <i>Nyet.</i>

385
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:30,113
I know a lot of people
have been having fun

386
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:32,315
claiming that I said
I found alien life.

387
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:33,783
I want to make it clear

388
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:36,519
that is not what I said.

389
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:38,921
I did say that was
one possible explanation.

390
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,923
I don't think
that's something to mock.

391
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:43,459
Right? It would be arrogant
for us to assume

392
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:45,728
that we are alone
in the universe.

393
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:47,897
And as scientists,
we need to remain open

394
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:50,733
to the possibility
that the truth may sound silly

395
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:52,168
or far-fetched.

396
00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:55,071
Uh, the round Earth.
Germs that cause diseases.

397
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,405
Subatomic particles.

398
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:58,407
All these at one time
seemed fanciful.

399
00:15:58,476 --> 00:16:00,743
So who's to say
what science fiction of today

400
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:02,645
will be the reality of tomorrow?

401
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:06,082
Will there be colonies on Mars?

402
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:08,184
Uh, matter transporters?

403
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:10,686
Perhaps the Loch Ness Monster
is real.

404
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:13,322
Who knows?
I'm just saying that...

405
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:15,825
the only way
science moves forward

406
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:18,494
is to follow the evidence
wherever it leads,

407
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:21,364
even if it makes us
sound crazy sometimes.

408
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:23,099
Hey, Bernie,
look at this.

409
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:25,935
"Caltech astrophysicist claims

410
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:28,971
Loch Ness Monster is real."

411
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:35,611
- Hey. How did it go?
- Great.

412
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,946
What, so you got the job?

413
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:39,048
I did not.

414
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:41,284
So you quit?
Okay, Leonard, I can't move.

415
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:44,187
I just bought a six-month
membership to SoulCycle.

416
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,323
Well, I-I didn't quit.

417
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:48,658
I said I was going to.

418
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:51,093
I walked out the door
and started crying.

419
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:54,697
You know, "Oh, my, God, oh, my
God, oh, my God, what'd I do?"

420
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:57,033
And then he called me back in.

421
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,668
Then he changed his mind?

422
00:16:58,736 --> 00:16:59,802
He did not.

423
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:01,804
I'm really confused about

424
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:03,773
how to react to this story.

425
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:07,343
President Siebert
didn't want to lose me.

426
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:08,878
Even though
they couldn't make me

427
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:11,247
a lead investigator
on a plasma team,

428
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:13,249
there was an opening
for a co-lead

429
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:14,851
on a photon entanglement team.

430
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:16,118
How cool is that?

431
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:19,055
You're gonna have to tell me.

432
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:21,624
It's really cool.

433
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:24,093
Yay! Oh, I am so
happy for you.

434
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:27,597
I almost got what I wanted,
and it never would have happened

435
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:29,966
if you hadn't almost believed in me.
- Oh.

436
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:33,102
Let's celebrate.
What do you want to do?

437
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:35,872
Oh, please don't make me
decide another thing.

438
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,540
Hey, you want to go
to SoulCycle with me?

439
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:39,809
Give me a minute,
I'll think of something.

440
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,170
Now, I know what
You're you're thinking:

441
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:50,866
isn't Broccoli Hulk basically
just the Jolly Green Giant?

442
00:17:51,936 --> 00:17:53,903
That <i>is</i> what I was thinking.

443
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:56,272
Let's never discuss it again.

444
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,441
Really?

445
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,944
- Are you hiding from Penny again?
- No. No, no, no.

446
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:05,481
I-I went to SoulCycle with her,
and my legs hurt so bad, I...

447
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,084
literally can't stand up.

448
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:10,719
Sheldon, why don't you
keep him company.

449
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,923
All right.

450
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,927
Hello, Leonard.
Hey.

451
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,600
Have you ever wondered

452
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:28,137
what the Hulk would be like
if he were made of sherbet?

453
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:32,708
I give up.

454
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:35,444
