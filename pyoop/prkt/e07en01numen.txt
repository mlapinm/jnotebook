1
Oh, the... there's a 7:15 at the ArcLight.
2
Well, that doesn't give us much time to eat.
3
We can eat afterwards.
4
I'm not gonna eat at 10:00 at night.
5
Who am I, Hemingway?
6
Why do you think Hemingway ate at 10:00?
7
He spent a lot of time in Spain. They eat dinner late.
8
He also spent a lot of time in Florida.
9
Last time I was there, people were eating dinner at, like, 4:30.
11
You guys know that Hemingway had cats with six toes?
13
Six toes per foot or six toes total?
14
Okay.
15
It's official. We're never going to see the <i>Avengers.</i> Guys, just come on.
15
Make a decision.
17
I-I'm good with eating after.
18
- Mm, I'm kind of hungry now.
18
- Yeah, me, too.
19
- Then we'll eat before.
19
- Okay.
20
So, then, we can see the 3-D at 9:00 or the 2-D at 9:30.
21
3-D.
21
If I'm gonna see Thor, I want to feel like I could lick those abs.
23
Actually, 3-D kind of makes me queasy.
24
No, but we have to see it in 3-D.
25
We saw part one in 3-D, and the 2-D part two is not the part two of the 3-D part one.
27
He's got you there, Leonard.
27
Or he doesn't.
28
I don't really care anymore.
29
Okay, then, - we'll go see it in 3-D.
29
- No.
31
Sweetie, you shouldn't do things that make you feel bad.
32
Well, I'm doing this.
33
And of course he is.
34
He is a textbook satisficer.
35
That's not even a word.
36
Uh, yes, it is.
37
According to Nobel Prize-winning economist Herbert Simon, satisficing is a decision-making strategy whereby a person accepts whatever available option is satisfactory rather than seeking out a course of action that would make him happiest, as I just did when I explained what satisficing was.
44
He's right.
45
No one wanted to hear at.
46
He knew it, yet he plowed ahead.
47
I'm just trying to find a plan that makes everyone happy.
49
Except you.
50
Yeah, Leonard.
50
What would make you happy?
51
I could tell you about satisficing again.
52
You know, what would make me happy is if we just stop talking about this and see whatever movie you guys want to see whenever you want to see it.
56
Okay. But next time, we get to pick.
57
<b><font color="#00FF00">♪ The Big Bang Theory 12x20 ♪</font></b> <font color="#00FFFF">The Decision Reverberation</font> Original Air D ♪ Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state ♪ ♪ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started...

68
It's better.
68
The throwing up really helped.
69
Mm. I'm so sorry you missed the end of the movie.
70
Oh, it's okay.
71
Everyone talked about it so much on the ride home, I feel like I saw it.
73
Well, to be fair, you talked about the bathroom so much, we felt like we saw that, too.
75
I think I would've been okay if we weren't sitting so close.
77
Well, then, why did we sit so close?
78
Sheldon said, "Are these seats good for everyone?" What was I supposed to do, say no, like a maniac? - Sweetie, you have got to stand up for yourself.
81
You know, maybe Sheldon's right.
82
Maybe you are that word he said.
83
Satisficer?
84
Yeah, that!
84
That's the one.
85
Boy, sounds way more made-up when you say it.
86
I mean, come on, when was the last time you did something totally selfish without worrying about what anyone else wanted?
89
Uh...
90
according to my mother, I took my sweet time being born.
92
How is that selfish?
93
Apparently, she had dinner reservations.
94
And this is the telescope room where I spend a lot of my evenings.
96
Where's the telescope?
97
Hawaii.
98
That's cool.
99
Yeah, so, you know...
100
aloha.
101
What's that smell?
102
Uh, everyone has their own theory.
103
Dr. Tibourgh thinks it's mold.
104
I think it's Dr. Tibourgh.
105
So, what am I looking at?
106
Ah, this is live information from the Keck telescope.
106
It's pretty interesting.
108
So, I recently observed some optical flashes.
109
It could be light bouncing off a natural object, but those tend to be less reflective, so could be evidence of something alien-made.
112
Oh, this suddenly got exciting.
113
Oh. When you say "exciting," do you mean "go back to my place" exciting or "hold our breath and do it here"?
116
Mahalo.
117
Do I want to ask?
118
Oh, w... when I go upstairs, Penny's gonna make me choose what we're gonna do tonight without taking her feelings into consideration, and I-I don't know if I'm up for it.
122
Poor baby.
122
When I go upstairs, Sheldon's gonna give me a 25-minute lecture about what Hulk would be like if he were made of metal.
125
Part of his ongoing series, "What If Hulk Were Made of Other Things?" I-I've always been a people pleaser.
128
Is that so bad?
128
It's gotten me this far.
129
What, almost up four flights of stairs?
130
Okay, if I go in there and pick something I want to do that she also wants to do, she's gonna think I'm just picking it to make her happy.
133
So I feel like I have to pick something I know she doesn't want to do or she's gonna be disappointed.
136
Right?
136
What do you think?
137
Think I've got ice cream in this bag that's starting to melt.
139
I'm sorry.
140
It's exhausting being in my head.
141
Look, when you wanted Penny, you didn't care what anybody else thought or wanted, including Penny.
144
That's true.
145
Yeah, yeah, there was something I wanted, I went after it and I got it.
147
Now you're hiding from it on the stairs, so it all worked out.
148
Hey.
149
I thought about what I want to do tonight, and I didn't take your feelings into consideration at all.
151
Great.
152
I want to have sex.
153
Wow, sex with your wife.
154
You're really swinging for the fences there, Hofstadter.
155
Yeah, we don't have to.
156
No!
157
I like it.
157
Let's go.
158
Oh, o-okay.
159
And then after that, we're gonna watch <i>Star Trek: Discovery.</i> - All right.
161
Well, just a warning, I might be on my phone for most of it.
162
That's fine.
163
Wait, you mean just the <i>Star Trek...</i> Actually, I don't care.
165
And, with apologies to Lady Gaga, that's how a star is born.
167
Told you he was gonna mention Lady Gaga.
168
At least he didn't talk about how much he cried during that movie.
170
Although, if you haven't seen that movie, you should.
172
I cried so much.
173
Well, that's the lecture for today.
174
Uh, let's open it up for questions.
175
Uh...
176
Oh, you! Sir, yes.
177
You have a question?
178
Yeah. Actually, I have a two-part question.
179
Are you sure? I get the sense it's only one part.
180
No, no, it's two.
181
Part one: the new star you were talking about-- how long did it take that light to reach Earth?
184
And part two: is it true you plant your friends in the audience to ask questions?
187
46,000 years.
188
And no, I don't plant my friends, because apparently, I don't have any.
190
Uh, any other questions?
191
- Uh, yes. You, miss.
191
- Hi.
192
I read your paper on specular reflections. It was great.
193
- Oh, thank you so much.
193
- In your conclusion, you said you couldn't rule out that light flashes could be evidence of alien civilization.
196
So does that mean you think it's aliens?
197
I was just illustrating that there are many unknowns, and as scientists, we can't preemptively rule out possibilities.
200
So you think it's aliens.
201
- A-Actually, no, that's...
201
- I have a question about the aliens you found.
203
That's not what I said, Howard.
204
Hold on a second.
205
Do you two know each other?
206
Yeah.
207
My sister was-- a-and this is her term-- abducted.
209
Do you think those could be the same aliens...
210
Okay, any other questions? Mm.
211
Not about aliens?
212
What?
213
Do you still want me to ask the one you gave me?
214
'Cause it kind of feels like we're past that.
215
Ooh, Leonard, I don't mean to alarm you, but the Chinese food smells funny.
217
That's because it's barbecue.
218
But it's Chinese food night.
219
Um, I picked it. You're the one who told me to stop being such a satisficer all the time.
221
What?
221
I did not.
222
I just pointed out that you were one.
223
It's what I like best about you.
224
Well, that and those little notes you leave in my lunch.
225
I leave those!
226
Well, that's disappointing.
227
I already know that you heart me.
228
Now I don't know if Leonard does.
229
Well, this is what we're having for dinner.
230
You can eat it or not.
230
I don't care.
231
I guess that answers the heart question.
232
I-It's fine.
232
We'll have barbecue.
233
Oh, of course.
233
I'm nothing if not flexible.
234
I'm sure that at some point in the 3,000-year history of the Chinese empire, a cavalryman crossing the Gobi Desert was forced by hunger to eat his own horse and roast it over a campfire, hence, Chinese barbecue.
234
Let's eat.
240
Gee, I'm sorry, I didn't watch the news today.
241
Has the whole world gone mad?
242
It's my house.
243
I'm tired of being told where I can and can't sit.
244
You did this.
245
Amy, grab your meat.
245
We're leaving in a huff.
246
I'm sorry, if I don't go now, it's not a huff.
247
Don't take this the wrong way, but that was even more exciting than the sex.
249
Don't take this the wrong way, but yes, it was.
250
Leonard, where are you going?
251
Well, to work.
252
Just trying out a different route.
253
Okay.
254
If we cross the county line, it's technically kidnapping.
255
Well, if you don't approve of my driving, too bad.
256
This is the new me.
256
Get used to it.
257
Fine.
257
Then this is the new me, and he finds the new you tiresome.
259
How is that different than the old you?
260
The new me gives knowing winks.
261
Well, all these years, I-I was afraid to say what I wanted.
263
You know, even at work, you know, there's things I want to accomplish, but I didn't want to ruffle any feathers or step on any toes.
266
Feathers and toes?
266
Is the new thing you're trying to accomplish ballroom dancing with a chicken?
268
Look at that-- the new me is hilarious.
269
Always wanted to be the principal investigator on a plasma physics study.
271
Hey, look at that-- the new you's funny, too.
272
I'm serious.
272
You know...
273
I'm gonna put together a proposal and tell President Siebert this is what I want to do.
275
If he doesn't let me, there's plenty of other universities that will.
277
Sure there are.
278
Of course you don't want me to do that, because you like it when you're successful and I'm not.
280
No, you're confusing causation and...
281
"Welcome to Alhambra." Where the heck are we?
282
Now I'm some sort of big joke.
283
I'm even on some alien conspiracy blog.
284
See? "Caltech astrophysicist finds proof of alien life'' Wow, that is not a great picture of you.
287
That's not the point.
288
Dr. Koothrappali.
289
I'm surprised to see you in here.
289
Why is that?
290
Because the truth...
291
is out there!
292
You see? That's what I'm talking about.
293
People have been doing that to me all day.
294
Relax.
294
They're just having fun.
295
Oh, come on!
296
See? It's fun.
297
Wow. Déjà vu.
298
Amy, you're a neuroscientist-- you know the latest research into déjà vu suggests it's nothing but the frontal regions of the brain attempting to correct an inaccurate memory.
302
You telling me stuff I already know is definitely déjà vu.
304
How about telling me something I don't know, like why you're sitting on the stairs.
306
How can I tell if I'm doing something for a noble reason or a selfish reason?
308
Try saying the thing in your head and see if you can add the words, "That'll show 'em." Leonard's about to demand a job that I don't think the university will give him.
312
I'm worried he's making a giant mistake.
313
But maybe I only think that because deep down I don't want him to succeed.
315
The fact that you're worried about your motivation supports the idea that you genuinely care for your friend.
317
I do.
318
Thank you, Amy.
319
You know what?
320
After I've talked to Leonard, you've earned yourself a bonus lecture on Sponge Hulk.
322
That'll show me.
323
So, I spent the whole day putting together this proposal, and tomorrow I'm gonna tell President Siebert that this is what I want to do.
326
Oh. Well, this...
327
looks great.
328
- You didn't even open it.
328
- Well, no, it's got a nice, you know, science-y heft to it. I...
331
Really proud of you, sweetie.
332
Leonard?
333
- Hmm?
333
- Um, I have been agonizing over whether or not to say something to you.
336
Aw. Let me help. Don't.
337
I have to.
338
I don't think that you should demand to be in charge of a plasma project.
340
Well, big surprise.
341
You can't stand the idea of me succeeding.
342
No. I'll be honest.
343
New assertive Leonard is going to take some getting used to.
344
But so did cargo pants Leonard, hmm?
345
Who, for the record, I miss.
346
He always had gum.
347
Sheldon, if this is what he wants, he should ask for it.
348
I mean, what's the worst that happens? They say no.
349
Well, I'm not gonna let them say no.
350
If they don't want me to quit, this is what it's gonna take.
351
Wait, you're gonna quit?
352
Yeah. It's like you said, I have to go after what I want, and if I can't get that at Caltech, there are plenty of other universities in the world.
355
W... In the world?
356
I can't even get you to go to the beach, and now you want to move to the world?
358
Well, I don't want to, but if that's what I have to do...
359
Okay, don't you think threatening to quit your job is something you should run by me first?
362
You said I shouldn't worry about your feelings.
363
I meant feelings about things that I don't care about!
364
Now, I'm not quite sure when to jump in here...
365
- Not now.
365
- Okay.
366
Fine, you want to talk about it?
366
Let's talk about it.
367
I-I'm not loving my job right now.
368
And this is something that would make me happy.
369
Don't you want me to be happy?
370
Oh, I've been dinged on this before.
371
Whatever you really think, you have to say yes.
372
- Of course I want you to be happy.
372
- Well played.
373
Okay, I know this seems scary, but I put together a strong proposal.
375
It's good for me, it's good for the university.
376
They're gonna give it to me.
377
No.
378
I'm sorry, President Siebert, but I'm not taking no for an answer.
380
I speak a little Russian.
381
Will you take <i>nyet</i> for an answer?
382
I'm serious.
383
Oh.
383
Well, that changes everything.
384
- Really?
384
- <i>Nyet.</i> I know a lot of people have been having fun claiming that I said I found alien life.
387
I want to make it clear that is not what I said.
389
I did say that was one possible explanation.
390
I don't think that's something to mock.
391
Right? It would be arrogant for us to assume that we are alone in the universe.
393
And as scientists, we need to remain open to the possibility that the truth may sound silly or far-fetched.
396
Uh, the round Earth.
396
Germs that cause diseases.
397
Subatomic particles.
398
All these at one time seemed fanciful.
399
So who's to say what science fiction of today will be the reality of tomorrow?
401
Will there be colonies on Mars?
402
Uh, matter transporters?
403
Perhaps the Loch Ness Monster is real.
404
Who knows?
404
I'm just saying that...
405
the only way science moves forward is to follow the evidence wherever it leads, even if it makes us sound crazy sometimes.
408
Hey, Bernie, look at this.
409
"Caltech astrophysicist claims Loch Ness Monster is real." - Hey. How did it go?
409
- Great.
412
What, so you got the job?
413
I did not.
414
So you quit?
414
Okay, Leonard, I can't move.
415
I just bought a six-month membership to SoulCycle.
416
Well, I-I didn't quit.
417
I said I was going to.
418
I walked out the door and started crying.
419
You know, "Oh, my, God, oh, my God, oh, my God, what'd I do?" And then he called me back in.
421
Then he changed his mind?
422
He did not.
423
I'm really confused about how to react to this story.
425
President Siebert didn't want to lose me.
426
Even though they couldn't make me a lead investigator on a plasma team, there was an opening for a co-lead on a photon entanglement team.
430
How cool is that?
431
You're gonna have to tell me.
432
It's really cool.
433
Yay! Oh, I am so happy for you.
434
I almost got what I wanted, and it never would have happened if you hadn't almost believed in me.
434
- Oh.
436
Let's celebrate.
436
What do you want to do?
437
Oh, please don't make me decide another thing.
438
Hey, you want to go to SoulCycle with me?
439
Give me a minute, I'll think of something.
440
Now, I know what You're you're thinking: isn't Broccoli Hulk basically just the Jolly Green Giant?
442
That <i>is</i> what I was thinking.
443
Let's never discuss it again.
444
Really?
445
- Are you hiding from Penny again?
445
- No. No, no, no.
446
I-I went to SoulCycle with her, and my legs hurt so bad, I...
447
literally can't stand up.
448
Sheldon, why don't you keep him company.
449
All right.
450
Hello, Leonard.
450
Hey.
451
Have you ever wondered what the Hulk would be like if he were made of sherbet?
453
I give up.
454
Delicious.
