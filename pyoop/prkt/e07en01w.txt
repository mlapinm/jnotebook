Oh, the... there's a 7:15 at the ArcLight.
Well, that doesn't give us much time to eat.
We can eat afterwards?
I'm not gonna eat at 10:00 at night.
Who am I, Hemingway?
Why do you think Hemingway ate at 10:00?
He spent a lot of time in Spain. They eat dinner late!
He also spent a lot of time in Florida.
Last time I was there, people were eating dinner at, like, 4:30.
You guys know that Hemingway had cats with six toes?
