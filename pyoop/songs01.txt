T.O.Y. - Strange Modern Art
walls come tumbling down
exposition of my soul
drawn by yellow crayons
framed by innocence
no more words to say
coloured stills of my live
style of strange appearance
drawn in my heart
birds fly in the sky
exposition of my mind
filled with coloured oceans
seen through my eyes
no more time to waste
desolation in my heart
blue coloured pictures
state of the art
strange modern art
my pictures of the past won't be the last
strange modern life
my gallery of love built from above
T.O.Y. - Strange Modern Art

[Chorus:]
Ten o'clock postman
Bring me her letter
Ten o'clock postman
Make me feel better
Been so many days
Since that I've met her
Ten o'clock postman
Bring me her letter
Bring me her letter


I'm walking all over the room
Wonder why I don't stop biting my nails
Why carry this feeling of doom
A couple more hours and I'll get the mail
I'll get the mail

Finding it so hard to eat
The toast and the eggs they just don't taste the same
Hearing a noise in the street
I run to the window and cry out in vain

[Chorus]

Remembering that she said for sure
I'll write you the minute I'll get off the plane
Nothing, not one single word
It must come this morning or I'll go insane
I'll go insane

Now it's been almost five days
Could she have sent it by air or by rail
I hear someone's comin' this way
This must be it, yes it must be the mail

[Chorus]

Dance with Me (оригинал Dj Bobo)
I'm back again on a higher stage.
Listen to my party beat and get in rage
'Cause you know when I flow and I show you so
Which way is better, which way you got to go
To make a fun house party or noddy,
You gotta check this out, yo-la-da-di!
There's a party over there with glamours and glare,
So dance and move you - pump that body,
Move your body up and down,
Side to side, it is party time!
Yeah, that's right we're dancing tonight
'Till the sun is coming and the sky is bright,
Then we are coming to an end like you understand.
That I'm a party man did the best I can
To make you laugh again,
Now I'm out of the scene,
Ahahahah!
Another time, another place,
Another rhyme done for every race.
In your case we're getting rough,
I'm not going to stop until you get enough,
'Cause you groove back and forth, forth and back.
Then you see it yourself it's like a heart attack,
My rhymes are a combination, infiltration,
Situation all over the nation,
Like round and round, upside down!
Living my life 'till your feet are on the ground,
Then put your hands up in the air,
Wave them like you just don't care.
And if you are ready to rock, then rock with me!
Somebody say oh yeah, oh yeah!
Oh yeah, oh yeah!
Now it's just the time I think you are with it,
So make some room and space just to hit it,
Move, move that body!
Ba-didely didely di, yeah we make a party,
To the B to the O to the B to the O!
Wanna rock your body, wanna rock your soul,
But I never ever said - I do it better,
Just know the time - yes I'm clever.
The way you had expected, your heading for the end.
Right that was another story from the party man and his clan,
They will come again, show and improve you, it's not the end.
It's a jam session, my confession,
And truly hard yeah one obsession.
But the joke is over, you know what I mean,
The party is gone, I'm out of the scene...

Hunters of the Night
[Verse 1:]
You know you touch my heart,
You made me running hide,
I wanna feel your body by my side.
You walk the streets again,
You need a love and friend
To try to stop the burning
Deep inside.
Love comes, love grows,
But your heart knows...
Touch you, you look at me,

And the hurt shows.

[Chorus:]
Hunters of the night,
The look on everyone's face I see
Leaving me cold again in my heart, my memories.
Hunters of the night,
Another time I feel the need in me,
Reaching for you again,
Love is such a mystery.
Hunters of the night,
Hunters of the night!

[Verse 2:]
Wanna hold you close
But you just turn away,
Seems there's nothing left
That I can say.
The kind of love you need
Is just too hard to find,
You know, you can deceive
When you made up lies.
Love comes, love grows,
But your heart knows...
Touch you, you look at me,
And the hurt shows.

[Chorus:]
Hunters of the night,
The look on everyone's face I see
Leaving me cold again in my heart, my memories.
Hunters of the night,
Another time I feel the need in me,
Reaching for you again,
Love is such a mystery.
Hunters of the night,
Hunters of the night!

Pretty Young Girl
I know life is different to you,
First love can be frightening, that's true
But take me as your brother and your friend
And take me as your lover and your man

[Chorus:]
Pretty young girl on my mind,
How I wish you to be mine,
Girl, you're no child anymore,
Pretty young girl on my mind,
Don't you know, know I can't hide

Can't hide my feelings
You're my girl and you're sixteen

Don't know is it wrong, is it right?
Sweet girl, I want to love you tonight,
So take me as your brother and your friend,
But first of all I wanna be your man

All That She Wants (оригинал Ace of Base)
She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morning
Light and the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
O' what a morning
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you


All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby

All that she wants - all that she wants

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's a hunter you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever
It's a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants...

ref_015
Touch by Touch (оригинал Joy)
When I feel the time is right
And you're staying by my side
And the love you give to me
Makes my heart beat
When my fantasies fly away
But my feelings make me stay
I see the fire in your eyes
It makes my heart beat.

Do it, we still do it night and day
You're my all time lover

Do it, we still do it in a way
Like there is no other
Touch by touch
You're my all time lover
Skin to skin
Come under my cover.

When my heart is full of love
It makes me a turtle dove
Love's a game that we play
Night and day
When our love is clear and bright
It's our way to see the light
There's a fire in our hearts
Night and day.

[2x:]
Do it, we still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we still do it in a way
Like there is no other
Touch by touch
You're my all time lover
Skin to skin
Come under my cover.

Do it, we still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we still do it in a way
Like there is no other
Touch by touch.

Russian Lullaby (оригинал E-Type)
[Speak Russian]
[Privet, menya zovut E-Type!

When the seas are rolling in,
When the stars are shining clear,
When the ghosts are howling near,

Let's you and me enjoy the mach 5 speed of life

I Saw You Dancing
I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da my love

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da

I'm waiting for a chance

To get to know you
To ask for a dance
Just look into my eyes
And I'll take you to paradise

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da my love

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da

I'm falling, I'm falling
Cause life's not easy for me

Please touch me like you do
To have you near me
To go where you go
Why waste a lot of time
My love is not a serious crime

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da my love

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da

I'm falling to pieces
Who do you think you are
Maybe I've gone too far
Maybe I'm in love with you
Don't hurt me or treat me bad
Cause I will fight for what is mine
Say Yaki-Da
Cause life is meant for living

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da my love

I saw you dancing
And I'll never be the same again for sure
I saw you dancing

Flames of Love (оригинал Fancy)
What kind of man,
What kind of man am I
I try to walk where I just fell
I try to break a secret spells
In your eyes I feel
The flames of love

Flames of love, flames of love
I'm drowning in the sea of love
And enough is never enough
When I find myself deep in your eyes

Over and over again flames of love

What kind of fool,
What kind of fool am I
I look for shadows in the sun
Or memories of days to come
In your eyes I feel
The flames of love

Flames of love, flames of love
I'm drowning in the sea of love
And enough is never enough
When I find myself deep in your eyes
Over and over again flames of love

I surrender
To sweet death in your arms
In a wave of lustful life
You touch me so deep
I'm cry out melting in flames of love

Flames of love, flames of love
I'm drowning in the sea of love
And enough is never enough
When I find myself deep in your eyes
Over and over again flames of love

In the Army Now* (Status Quo)
A vacation in a foreign land
Uncle Sam does the best he can
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now
Now you remember what the draftman said
Nothing to do all day but stay in bed
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

You be the hero of the neiborhood

Nobody knows that you left for good
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Smiling faces as you wait to land
But once you get there no one gives a damn
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Hand grenades flying over your head
Missiles flying over your head
If you want to survive get out of bed
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Shots ring out in the dad of night
The sergeant calls: stand up and fight
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

You've got your orders better shoot on sight
Your finger's on the trigger
But it don't seem right
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Night is falling and you just can't see
Is this illusion or reality
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Oh, oh, you're in the army now

It's a Sin (Pet Shop Boys)
When I look back upon my life
It's always with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame

For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common too
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin

Everything I've ever done

Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

At school they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed

For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common too
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin

Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

Father forgive me
I tried not to do it
Turned over a new leaf
Then tore right through it
Whatever you taught me
I didn't believe it
Father you fought me
'Cause I didn't care
And I still don't understand

So I look back upon my life
Forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame

For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common too
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin

Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to I
It's a sin

Romantic fever in the middle of the night
You said, I know, you're counting my desire
Or let you go, my prisoner of love

Let yourself tonight...

Someone up there is smiling on your love
Be careful girl, I'll find you in my love
Baby, can't you see the danger in my eyes?

Believe in all your promise and your lies
But I feel
In the end I'll lose
Only you can turn my life
Can turn it just this way
Tonight I feel, I feel for you
Tonight I call, I'm calling your name
Tonight I feel, I feel for you - tonight
Touch in the night
It feels like heaven
Touch in the night
So lucky in love
Tonight I feel, I feel for you

Remember all the cries
It's a secret dream
I'm lost in your love
You
Your lonesome eyes are all I wanna know
Helpless tears
Can never stop the rain
Only you can turn my life
Can turn it just this way
REFRAIN:
Touch in the night
It feels like heaven
Touch in the night
So lucky in love
Lost in your light
Another secret
Touch in the night
Whatever I do
You
My angel in disguise
Deep inside my heart

Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

Gimme a sign

Just me and you
I can't go on

Baby don't hurt me

Set the World on Fire (E-Type)

So I am what I am
What I feel cannot be wrong
This is the way that I feel and I'm coming on strong
We're talking hundreds and thousands
With potential to stay
But only one with quality
Can turn the loneliness away, come follow me

One is a wonder
One is a wonder
But only

One is a wonder
One is a wonder

Set the world on fire
I'll do anything to get what I want
Aim even higher
I'll do anything to be the one

So I'm cruising round the continent
To see what I can find
A lot of fangs, but I refuse to be a slave to the ground
We're talking gadda-da-vida,
Honey now the deed is done
And if you're in you've got to show me
That you really are the one
Come follow me

One is a wonder
One is a wonder
But only
One is a wonder
One is a wonder

(I'm gonna) Set the world on fire
I'll do anything to get what I want
(I'm gonna) aim even higher
I'll do anything to be the one

Another night, another dream, but always you
It’s like a vision of love, it seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of love so true
Just another night (just another night)
Another night, another dream, but always you
It’s like a vision of love, it seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of love so true
In the night, in my dreams, I’m in love with you
'Cause you talk to me like lovers do
I I feel joy, I feel pain, 'cause it’s still the same
When the night is gone, I will be alone
Talk, talk, I’ll talk to you
In the night, in your dreams
Our love so true
Talk, talk, I’ll talk to you
In the night, in your dreams
Our love so true
Another night, another dream, but always you
It’s like a vision of love, it seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of love so true
Another night, another dream, but always you
It’s like a vision of love, it seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of love so true
In the night, in my dreams, I’m in love with you
'Cause you talk to me like lovers do When the night is gone, I will be alone
Just another night, it’s all that it takes
To understand the difference between lovers and fakes
So be there, be there

Joe le taxi
Y va pas partout
Y marche pas au soda
Son saxo jaune
Connait toutes les rues par coeur

Tous les p'tits bars
Tous les coins noirs
Et la Seine
Et ses ponts qui brillent


Dans sa caise
La musique a Joe
C'est la rumba
Le vieux rock au mambo

Joe le taxi
C'est sa vie
Le rhum au mambo
Embouteillage
Il est comme ca
Rhum et mambo
Joe - Joe - Joe

Dans sa caisse
La musique a Joe resonne
C'est la rumba
Le vieux rock au mambo bidon

Vas-y Joe

Dans la nuit vers l'amazone

Mister
Your eyes are full of hesitation
Sure makes me wonder
If you know what you're looking for.
Baby
I wanna keep my reputation
I'm a sensation
You try me once, you'll beg for more.

Yes Sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song.

I can boogie, boogie woogie
All night long.
Yes Sir, I can boogie,
If you stay, you can't go wrong.
I can boogie, boogie woogie, all night long

No Sir,
I don't feel very much like talking
No, neither walking
You wanna know if I can dance.
Yes Sir, already told you in the first verse
And in the chorus
But I will give you one more chance.

Yes Sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song.
I can boogie, boogie woogie
All night long.
Yes Sir, I can boogie,
If you stay, you can't go wrong.
I can boogie, boogie woogie, all night long

So don't forget it never

Fall in love forever
With you and I together
I will kiss you my darling
But let me keep on music
This in me I dream
With caresses I'll touch you
I will present my heart
But let me keep on music
Everything you like it
And everywhere you bring me
I will leave you my body
But let me keep on music
Every night
I'll be living to feel right
Sing forever
You'll feel it paradise
So you will dance forever
You can take my style

When we all give the power

Then you all get the power

When everyone gives everything and every song everybody sings.
Then it's live
live is life
live is life

Live is life - when we all feel the power.
Live is life - come on
stand up and dance!
Live is life - when the feeling of the people -
Live is life - is the feeling of the band.
When we all give the power
we all give the best. . . .
Then it's live
live is life

live is life

And you call when it's over

Every minute of the future is a memory of the past.
'Cause we all gave the power
we all gave the best.
And everyone gave everything and every song everybody sang.
Live is life.

What my heart wanna say
Laid in my dreams from yesterday
That's not my world can't you see?
I don't believe you go away
All you want is to be free
I know you do, what you have to do
You're looking for a new life
Maybe one time you will understand me
Our luck is more than to be free
Can't you feel what my heart wanna say
I love you, but you don't have to stay
You can go but I hope you'll come back
Cause your love I will never forget
As I know one day you will be mine
Please don't keep me waiting a long time
Can't you feel what my heart wanna say
I love you, but you don't have to stay
You can go but I hope you'll come back
Cause your love I will never forget
As I know one day you will be mine
Please don't keep me waiting a long time
I want you more than I can say
And it's alway been this way
I know you do, what you have to do
You're looking for a new life
Maybe one time you will understand me
Our luck is more than to be free
Can't you feel what my heart wanna say
I love you, but you don't have to stay
You can go but I hope you'll come back
Cause your love I will never forget
As I know one day you will be mine
Please don't keep me waiting a long time
Can't you feel what my heart wanna say

Station, happy station
Very special people you can meet at the station
Station, happy station (oh, happy station)
Glad and smiling faces come from different places
My suitcase and me we'll take a trip
It's a magic journey, I feel like burning
Lucky guy, follow me, you'll be alright
I'm crazy, don't you know
I'll never let you go
Would you like to do it?
Well, it's not, not too late
Tell me what you like
It could be so fine.
Come into my train, I can get you higher
You're the best, best, honey
The best, best lover tonight
Station, happy station?
Come with me and take the train
I don't want to stop here, wanna go there
(Go where?)
Where I'd like to see one million places
(What kind of places?)
Midnight is coming, follow me
Station, happy station?
Come with me and take the train...

I love your world
Where the winners might be sweet all around
Tell me your life.
Tell me what you'll be afraid of this night
If you wanna take a look around
Please don't hit a man who understands
As the story goes you are the one
Run away in other place
In the night you're looking for to meet
And checking the man to get in fit
Just the story goes you are the one
Run away in other place
Yeti, yeti, yeti, yeti
Yeti, looking a horrid man.
Yeti, living in other land
I want your soul and I really like to seem to your heart
I feel with you and I know that you are living apart

Blue (Eiffel 65)
[Intro:]
Yo, listen up, here's a story
About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue
Like him inside and outside
Blue his house with a blue little window and a blue Corvette
And everything is blue for him
And himself and everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen (to listen)

[Hook: 2x]

I'm Blue
Da ba dee da ba dye [7x]

[Verse 1:]
I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the color of all that I wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue
Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my Corvette that's standing outside
Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me

[Hook: 2x]
I'm Blue
Da ba dee da ba dye [7x]

Todos juntos vamos ya
a bailar con ese compas:
para el frente y para atras,
hacia abajo y a volar.

En la playa, en la montana,

cuando Flori se descalza
comienza la danza.

Un, dos, tres.

?Hey, derecha!

en un bar, en cada esquina,

No, no, no, no there's no limit!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no there's no limit!

No valley too deep,
No mountain too high,
No, no limits, won't give up the fight!

We do what we want
And we do it with pride

Let me hear us say yeah! (wow!)

Hard to the core, I feel the floor,
When I'm on stage, yo, ya answer more,
I'm on the edge, I know the ledge,
I work real hard to collect my cash!
Tick tick tick tick tаke your time,
When I'm going I'm going for mine,
Open your ears and you will hear it,
I tell you this 'cause there's no limit!

No limits allowed,
Cause there's much crowd,
Microphone check as I choose my route

I'm playing on the road, I've got no fear,
The sounds from my mouth is on record here,
There never will be no mountain too high,
Reach the top, touch the sky!
They tried to diss me
Cause I sell out...
I'm making techno and I am proud!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no ,no , no there's no limit!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no there's no limit!

No valley too deep,
No mountain too high,

Ice Ice Baby (Vanilla Ice)
All right stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly flow
like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop? Yo - I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.

Dance, bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom

deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gain way
You better hit bull's eye, the kid don't play
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you aint quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, waving just to say Hi
Did you stop? No - I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo - so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave.
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out geting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine - all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene, You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, you, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake, kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast, other DJs say, "damn"
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem, Yo - I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it.

All my friends often say
I should leave you alone
I'd like to see you again
When they tell me I'm wrong
Cause your heart's made of stone
I know they're right in the end
But you move to my dreams
Like a warm summer wind
Is not good to retain or just a lie
And the touch of your hand
Like a breeze on my skin
It's stronger than a warm wind in the sky
Storms of love - a gentle power
Storms of love without the charms
Storms of love
Like a preach it can bring me to my knees
I'm helpless when I'm longing to your arms
Storms of love - a restless flyer
Storms of love - a hurricane
Storms of love
In my heart they are tearing me apart
And I lose my control again
When I try and I try
Not to see you again
I change my apartment downtown
Call some girls late at night
Throw a party to friends
Music and fun all around
So I'm telling myself
Not to think about you
But my memory has lost a hopeless fight
And I'm safe and I'm strong
And then I'll make it through
A lonesome heart against the stormy night

The misty signs of laughter

Releasing one lost name
And the scar once healed forever
Dissolving in the rain

Back row of the drive in show
In the flickerin' light.
Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars
Became champange and caviar.
Makin' love on a long hot summer night.

I thought you fell in love
With me watching Casablanca
Holdin' hands 'neath the paddle fans,
In Rick's candle lit cafe

Hidin' the shadows from the spies.
Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
Makin' magic at the movies
In my own Cheverolet

Oh! A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca.
But a kiss is not a kiss
Without your sigh.
Please come back to me in Casablanca.
I love you more and more each day as time goes by.

I guess there are many broken hearts in Casablanca.
You know l've never really been there so l don't know.
I guess our love story will never be seen
On the big white silver screen.
But it hurts just as bad
When I had to watch you go.

I don't call it love
Come take me in your heart
Oh, I can't get enough
I know we will never part
We are nightbirds my baby
Nightbirds will never stop
Oh, you're playing with fire
Lost in my desire
Baby, you're so hot

My bed is too big

Too big without you, baby
I wanna have your body
Come gimme what you've got
My bed is too big
Too big without you, lady
I wanna have no heartache
Come hit me with your shot

In a world of stone
Love'll never been the same
I hate to be alone - tired of playing games
You like coctails at midnight
Diamonds and silver a lot
You're a woman behind me
Oh, set my heart free

Stop that crying
Stop that lying
It's boring me
I don't wanna spend my time with you
Stop to think
That once you brought me to exctasy
I want the loving that I really need
RAP:
Stop, you breathe you lie
Loops got ya lost I can't hear ya
Treason took a try
Desperate drown in dirty things
Juvenile Jazz you hide
Can't loose no love from day I shared
Faint twinkle in your eyes
Weary from how you earn your things
You slip from sliding
Slowly, slither, sneaky
Simple for a snake
Poser in pursuit of passion
Can't rush my quiver fake a quake
Betrayer, disarrayer,
Leave a soft one frying in the pain
Deceitful, full of that
Couldn't care less if you're crying in the rain
CHORUS:
Stop that crying
Stop that lying
It's boring me
I don't wanna spend my time with you
Stop to think
That once you brought me to exctasy
I want the loving that I really need
Wooh, oh, hoh
Stop that crying in the rain now
No more crying in the rain
Who said that crying in the rain
Could ever wash away a lover's pain
Wooh, oh, hoh
Stop that crying in the rain now
No more crying in the rain
Who said that crying in the rain
Could ever wash away a lover's pain
Wooh, oh, hoh

Corleone Speaking (оригинал Silicon Dream)
Pronto!

Who's speaking?

This is a long distance call from... from Chicago

Corleone speaking

Chicago is hot
The whiskey is not
In The Summer of 29...

Gangs in the street
Gambling in heat
Big boss still on the line
Mamma a napoli
Far across the sea

Corleone speaking

Police on the run
From winchester gun
The city is on fire
New York to Frisco
Let the news go
On talking wire
Mamma a napoli
Far across the sea

Corleone speaking

Midnight in town
Limousines around
In the summer of 29
Hotel Ritz
Ballroom blitz
Big boss still on the line
Mamma a napoli
Far across the sea
Corleone speaking

Corleone speaking

Pronto

I got two strong arms
Blessings of babylon
With time to carry on
And try
For sins and alarms
So to america the brave
Wise men save
Near a tree by a river
There's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of aran
Goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon
In the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
Near a tree by a river
There's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of aran
Goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon
In the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you
Near a tree by a river
There's a hole in the ground
Where a old man of aran
Goes around an around
And his mind is a beacon
In the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
Near a tree by a river
There's a hole in the ground
Where a old man of aran
Goes around an around
And his mind is a beacon
In the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you
I got plans for us
Nights in the scullery
And day instead of me
I only know what to discuss
Of for anything but light
Wise men fighting over you
It's not me you see
Pieces of valentine
With just a song of mine
To keep from burning history
Seasons of gasoline and gold
Wise men fold
Near a tree by a river
There's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of aran
Goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon
In the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you
I got time to kill
Sly looks in corridors
Without a plan of yours
A blackbird sings on bluebird hill
Thanks to the calling of the wild
Wise mens child

You Can't Touch This* (M.C. Hammer)
You can't touch this [4x]

My-my-my-my (You can't touch this) music hits me so hard
Makes me say,"oh my lord thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet"
It feels good
When you know you're sown
A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat-uh!
You can't touch this


I told you homeboy
You can't touch this
Yeah, that's how we livin' and you know
You can't touch this
Look in my eyes,man
You can't touch this
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics
You can't touch this

Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that now you know you wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rolling
Hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on
Like that
Like that
Cold on a mission so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat
They can't touch

Yo! I told you
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Yo,sound the bells, school is in, sucker
You can't touch this

Give me a song or rhythm
Making 'em sweat
That's what I'm giving'em
Now they know
You talk about the Hammer, you're talking about a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweating so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What it is going to take in the '90s
To burn the charts
Legit either work hard or you might as well quit

That's the word,because you know
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Break it down

Stop. . . Hammer time

Go with the funk
It is said
That if you can't groove to this
Then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it for a winter
Dance to this an' you're gonna get thinner
Move slide your rump
Just for a minute, let's all do the bump
Bump bump bump

Yeah, You can't touch this
Look man, You can't touch this
You better get hyped
Boy 'cause you know ya can't
You can't touch this
ref_129
Please don't go. Please don't go

Let's stay together
Please don't go. Please don't go
You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever
No, no! No, no!

You let a good thing fall apart
If you decive me
You leave a pain inside my heart
I really need you
Just like the air I need to breathe
I'll stand beside you; I'll never leave
Please don't go. Please don't go
I don't wanna be all alone
Say you're mine and give me tonight

I will try harder
I'll make you fall in love again
And I'll be faithful until the end
Please don't go. Please don't go
(Don't go!)
You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever
No, no!
If you leave me I'm gonna search the world for you
If you leave me
Sweet memories will shine on through
I'll always love you,
No matter what you do or say
Cos when I touch you
Night turns to day
Please don't go. Please don't go
Don't you know that I love you so?
Say you're mine and give me tonight
Let's stay together
Please don't go. Please don't go
You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever
No, no!

When you're feeling all right
Everything is upt-ight
Try to sing a song that goes Ding-Ding-A-Dong.
There will be no sorrow
When you sing tomorrow
And you walk along with your Ding-Ding-Dong.
Dinge-Dong
every hour
when you pick a flower
Even when your lover is gone
gone
gone.
Dinge-Dong
listen to it
maybe it's a big hit.
Even when your lover is gone
gone
gone
sing Ding-Ding-Dong.

When they sing a song that goes Ding-Ding-Dong.

every hour . . .
Ding-Dang-Dong

When you think it's all over
They let me down;
Dry your tears and forget all your sorrow
Try to smile when you'tl say good-bye.

Well

Tell me where's my way

Imagine your face
In a sunshine reflection
A vision of blue skies
Forever distractions

Love me now and again

It's My Life (оригинал Dr. Alban)
It's my life take it or leave it
Set me free what's that crap papa-know-it-all
I got my own life you got your own life
Live your life and set me free
Mind your business and leave my business
You know everything papa-know-it-all
Very little knowledge is dangerous
Stop bugging me stop bothering me
Stop bugging me stop forcing me
Stop fighting me stop yelling me
It's my life


[Chorus:]
It's my life it's my life my worries
It's my life it's my life my problems
It's my life it's my life my worries
It's my life it's my life my problems

It's my life do you understand
I live the way I want to live
I make decisions day and night
Show me signs and good examples
Stop telling me how to run your business
Take a trip to east and west
You find that you don't know anything
Every's getting tired of you
Sometimes you have to look and listen
You can even learn from me
Little knowledge is dangerous
It's my life

[Chorus:]
It's my life it's my life my worries
It's my life it's my life my problems
It's my life it's my life my worries
It's my life it's my life my problems

It's my life set me free
So you're bad so you lie
What you see is what you get
Listen to people are...
Things I do I do that no more
Things I say I say that no more
Changes come once in life
Stop bugging me stop bothering me
Stop bugging me stop forcing me
Stop fighting me stop yelling me
Stop telling me stop seeing me
It's my life

[Chorus:]
It's my life it's my life my worries
It's my life it's my life my problems
It's my life it's my life my worries
It's my life it's my life my problems

Take your chance
Bring your life up to the top
And you never ever stop
And you try to do it right
You better take your chance
And luck will always be around
Keep your feet down on the ground
And you will never be alone
Come on come on take your chance
Your life is very hard
No time for romance
You know that life is hard
But you know that you'll make it
There is only one chance in life
And you better take it
You got some hard time
You got some bad time
You got some ruff time and you got some sad times

Think about today what's up for tomorrow
What you really want is a chance to be free
How you're livin' what's about 'g'
Take a look in a looking glass
In a life class
Just watch me blass
That microphone is right straight to your heart

Ma Baker (оригинал Boney-M)
Freeze! I'm Ma baker - put your hands in the air,
Gimme all your money

This is the story of Ma baker, the meanest cat
From ol' Chicago town
She was the meanest cat
In old Chicago town
She was really moved them down
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all
She was the meanest cat

Oh she was realy tough
She left her husband flat
He wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along
'Cause they were mean and strong

Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - to handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - she never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma - Ma Baker - but she knew how to die

They left a trail of crime
Across the U.S.A
And when one boy was killed

She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all

She met a man she liked
She thought she'd stay with him
One day he formed with them
They did away with him
She didn't care at all
Just didn't care at all

Oh-oh-oh-oh, tonight (4x)
Tonight why have you changed my life this way?
Why can't you just come back and stay?
Since you're gone I miss you so
I was a fool to let you go
'Cause you took my breath away this time
CHORUS:
Tonight I'm walking in the rain

I know that it's a shame
I cannot stand tears in my eyes

And something in your eyes can't hide
That you're still in love with me
Or is it just my destiny
One more time to stay alone again?

New York City Boy (Pet Shop Boys)
When you're a boy
some days are tough
lying on your bed
playing punk rock and stuff
Home is a boot camp
you gotta escape
Wanna go and wander
in the ticker-tape
You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run

into New York City

New York City boy
you'll never have a bored day
'cause you're a New York City boy
where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

The street is amazing
the hoochies unreal
Check out all the hardware
at the latest deal
Hear a song
That's the bomb!
If you don't get that mix
it's gone eighty-six
You feel the deal is real
You're in New York City

New York City Boy
you'll never have a bored day
'cause you're a New York City boy
where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
New York City boy
This is your reward day
'cause you're a New York City boy
where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

Then when the evening falls
you can return its calls

You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run
into New York City

Big in Japan (Alphaville)
Winter's cityside
Crystal bits of snowflakes
All around my head and in the wind
I had no illusions
That I'd ever find a glimpse
Of summer's heatwaves in your eyes
You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight

It's easy when you're big in Japan

Ah when you're big in Japan tonight
Big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, ooh the eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan, alright
Pay then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan
Oh when you're big in Japan

Neon on my naked skin,
Passing silhouettes
Of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo
Or should I go and change my point of view
For other ugly scenes
You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're big in Japan

Ah when you're big in Japan tonight

S.O.S. (La Bouche)
Sending you an S.O.S of love,
You're all I'm thinking of,
Would you be mine,
Be my destiny tonight

Sending you an S.O.S of love,
You're all I'm thinking of,
Would you be mine,
Be my destiny, my everything in love

Every night before I turn out the light

I get down on my knees
And I pray for the day,
When we can become
A little closer to one
And maybe then you'd be ready,
Ready to hear my S.O.S.,
Can you see that I am...

Dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot

Just when I knew that I was in love with you,
I thought how could it be that I would deny
The chance to express and offer you happiness
And baby, now I am ready,
Oh won't you hear my S.O.S.
Can't you see that I am....

So I'm sending you S.O.S of love tonight
Dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot

Destiny it’s here for you, it's here for me,
Sending out an S.O.S of love divine,
On the line give it to you
Rain or shine,
In my mind it’s you I want, you I need
Girl, you I crave

Dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot

So hear my S.O.S
I'll send it with a kiss from me,
S.O.S I love the way you touch my body,
Now that I found you, I'll never let you go
And that's why I am....

But I will love you,baby, time will show
I'l give you everything
And that's no compromise
See my broken wings
To your alibies
Crying ninety tears no sacrifice
Broken souvenirs in paradise
Oh,I never promised you love
Oh,when my heart is not enough
Oh, it's like an ocean of love to me
I'm not your Romeo and you're not Juliet
After the curtain falls
I'll drive you mad
Oh,baby,heaven just sweet heaven has sent you
I'm not your Romeo and you're not Juliet
But I will love you,love you,love you
Drive you mad
Oh,baby,there will never be another you
Love on the telephone, it's killing me
I'l sail my ship alone
Old memory
Back to Babilon, in my fantasy
Gonna lock my heart and losing the key
Oh,I never promised you love
Oh, when my heart is not enough
Oh, it's like an ocean of love to me
I'm not your Romeo and you're not Juliet
After the curtain falls
I'll drive you mad
Oh, baby, heaven just sweet heaven has sent you

Oh,baby,there will never be another you

There's a boy in my mind and he knows
I am thinking of him
All my way through the day and the night
Stars shine above me
He's been gone for sum time
But i know i truley love him
And iam singing a song
Hoping he'll be back when he hears it
My heart goes shalalala shalala in the morning
Shalalala shalala in the sunshine
Shalalala shalala in the evening
Shalalala shalala just for you!(make sum noise for the vengaboys!)
If your lucks gone away just like mine
You feel like crying
Sing along maybe once
Maybe twice lets try it together
Sum sweet day no one knows you'll return and you'll be happy
Shouting sweet in a song
Listen to your heart it is singing
My heart goes shalalala shalala in the morning
Shalalala shalala in the sunshine
Shalalala shalala in the evening
Shalalala shalala just for you!
My heart goes shalalala shalala in the morning
Shalalala shalala in the sunshine

I Will Survive* (оригинал Gloria Gaynor)
First I was afraid, I was petrified!
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong,
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along.

And so you're back from outerspace,
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I shoulda changed that stupid lock, I shoulda made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me.

Go on now go, walk out the door.

Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I! I will survive!
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive.
I've got all my life to live,
And I've got all my love to give,

I'll survive, I will survive!
Hey hey..

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart,
And tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart.
And I spent oh so many nights just feelin' sorry for myself, I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high,

And you'll see me, somebody new;
I'm not that chained up little girl who's still in love with you.
So you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free,
But now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me,

Go on now go, walk out the door.
Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I! I will survive!
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
And I've got all my love to give,

I'll survive, I will survive!
Oh..

Go on now go, walk out the door.
Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I! I will survive!
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
And I've got all my love to give,

I'll survive, I will survive!

In the Heat of the Night (оригинал Sandra)
Talk to me - want my love.
Talk to me - but not that stuff.
You ain't get enough using my love.
You call for me again, l see.

In the heat of the night
You lose control and sell your soul
I lose control in the heat of the night
It's much too late to leave the trade
But I can't stand it anymore
You lose your heart and sell your soul

I lose control in the heat of the night

In the heat of the night.

Talk to me - want my love.
Talk to me - but not that stuff

Who's on my side losing my pride?
You call for me again, I see.

In the heat of the night
You lose control and sell your soul
I lose control in the heat of the night
It's much too late to leave the trade
But I can't stand it anymore
You lose your heart and sell your soul
I lose control in the heat of the night

In the heat of the night. [2x]

You lose control and sell your soul

Sometimes be strangers today

Nights won't last forever, girl
Strange are the ways of this world,
Oh heartache, here comes heartache,
Cinderella, heroes wait,
For your hard times it's too late,
Oh heartache, here comes heartache

[Chorus]

Strangers tonight
Be strangers tomorrow,
Lady, tonight
Tonight be careful with love,
Some love is too hot, too hot to stop
A bad fall tomorrow,
And lovers by night
Sometimes be strangers today

And lovers by night
Sometimes be strangers today
