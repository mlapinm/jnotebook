The key points from this module are: 
The latest version of HMTL is HTML5. The latest version of CSS is CSS3.

HTML is the acronym for Hyper-text Markup Language
CSS is the acronym for Cascading Style Sheets

When saving a .html file in Notepad the encoding should be changed to UTF-8

Web pages have the following file extension name: .html

The file extension for a CSS file: .css

 <> keys are used to create tags in HTML
Example: Paragraph element:
<p> the opening paragraph tag
</p> the closing paragraph tag
<!DOCTYPE html> declares an HTML5 document:
<html> </html> define the boundaries of an HTML web page

Every HTML web page contains Head section and Body section:
<head> </head> represent the head section of a web page
<body> </body> represent the body section of a web page 

Cascading Style Sheets:
A correctly formatted CSS style: hi {font-size:2em; >, use {} keys

Progressive enhancement: a strategy for web design which emphasizes accessibility, semantic HTML
markup, and external stylesheet and scripting technologies.

Web links:
      Absolute URL - href="http://www.alison.com"
      Relative URL - href="another.html"

Attributes:
      <html lang="en"> the 'lang' is known as the Attribute of the tag
      <!DOCTYPE html> declares an HTML5 document
      <html> </html> define the boundaries of an HTML web page

Every HTML web page contains Head section and Body section:
      <head> </head> represent the head section of a web page
      <body> </body> represent the body section of a web page

Global attributes:
Global attributes that can be added to virtually any HTML5 element:
• id attribute
• name attribute
• class attribute

id attribute - Provides programmatic access via JavaScript (on client)
name attribute - Provides programmatic access (on the server)
class attribute - CSS hook for stylings

```
