```

The key points from this module are:
JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
   
    All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable. 
   
    function substitute () {var myValue = document.getElementByldQ.value;}

           - function name is substitute
           - variable name is myValue

var - declare a JavaScript variable
var myName; a correctly declared variable in JavaScript
var myName = "John"; a correctly declared value to a variable
identifiers • name is given to the unique names that help identify JavaScript variables


Variable types
• var length = 16; // Number
• var lastName = ''Johnson"; // String
• var cars = ["Saab", 'Volvo", "BMW"]; // Array
• var person = null; // Null value
• var x = {firstName:"John"}; // Object
• var x; // x is undefined
• var x = true; // Boolean
• var car =// Empty value

Some general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers):
• Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
• Names must begin with a letter.
• Names can begin with $ and _
• Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
• Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

Examples of HMTL events which JavaScript can react to:
• An HTML web page has finished loading
• An HTML input field was changed
• An HTML button was clicked


HTML events:
• onchange - An HTML element has been changed
• onclick - The user clicks an HTML element
• onmouseover - The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
• onmouseout - The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
• onkeydown - The user pushes a keyboard key
• onload - The browser has finished loading the page

Methods that can be used to let JavaScript work with events:
• HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
• HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
• You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements

The main types of errors in JavaScript code:
• Syntax errors - Code is improperly formatted
• Runtime Exceptions - Missing reference to function or variable

To minimize handling errors in JavaScript you must insulate your application against exceptions caused by relying on external resources.

Assignment operators
= an 'assignment" operator in JavaScript
+= assignment operator - adds a value to a variable
*= assignment operator - multiplies a variable
/= assignment operator - divides a variable
-= assignment operator - subtracts a value from a variable
   -   
   
   
   
   


```
## MODULE 8 JavaScript Programming Concepts
#### In this module you will learn about the different types of JavaScript loops (for, for/in, while and do/while loops) and their correct syntax. You will learn about JavaScript arrays which are objects used to store multiple values in a single variable. You will also learn about the different types of 'falsy' values and 'truthy' values. Finally, you will learn about the main types of errors in JavaScript code and how to minimize these errors.
```

Upon successful completion of this module you will be able to:
List and use conditional statements in JavaScript.
List and use JavaScript equality operators.
Describe 'falsy' values and 'truthy' values.
List and use JavaScript loops.
Recognise how to format and use arrays in JavaScript.
Describe the types of scope in JavaScript.

```


(function() {
  if (true) 
  {
    var myScope = "myScopeLock";
  }
  //myScope = "I set this inside the function";
  document.write(myScope+" "+ window.myScope + "\n")
  document.write("<br>")
})();

 document.write('window.myScope: ' + window.myScope);


```

### JavaScript Array
### Looping Statements In JavaScript
```

var playlist = new Array();
playlist[1] = "The Yoy Formidable"
playlist[2] = "Young the Giant"
playlist[3] = "Washed Out"
document.write("333")

var i = 0
while (i < playlist.length){
    document.write("<br> Now Playing: " + playlist[i])
    i++
}

// 333
// Now Playing: undefined
// Now Playing: The Yoy Formidable
// Now Playing: Young the Giant
// Now Playing: Washed Out

```
### Understanding Function Versus Global Scope
### JavaScript Programming Concepts - Lesson Summary

```

The key points from this module are:
Conditional statements
      if                - Use this to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
      else           - Use this to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
      else if        - Use this to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
      switch       - Use this to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

Equality operators
      ==equal to
      = equal value and equal type
      != not equal
      !== not equal value or not equal type

Equality operators «« and != are considered "evil" because they perform implicit type coercion.



'falsy' values:
      false
      0 (zero)
      " " (empty string)
      null
      undefined
      NaN (a special Number value meaning Not-a-Number!)
'truthy' values:
      "O" (zero in quotes)
      "false” (false in quotes)
      empty functions

JavaScript function - a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
Function parameters - the names listed in the function definition.
Function arguments - the real values received by the function when it is invoked.
A function without a name is called Anonymous function

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by
parentheses ().

The following can be contained in a function name
• Letters
• Digits
• Underscores
• Dollar signs


JavaScript loops:
      for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
      for/in - loops through the properties of an object.
      while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
      do/while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

The Array object is used to store multiple values in a single variable
Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

Syntax:
      - var array-name = [iteml, item2, ...];
      - Arrays with named indexes are called Associative arrays

JavaScript scope:
      Local scope - Variables declared within a JavaScript function
      Global scope - A variable declared outside a function
      Automatically Global scope - Assign a value to a variable that has not been declared.





```

## MODULE 9 JavaScript And The Document Object Model
#### In this module you will be introduced to the concept of the Document Object Model and how you can add greater functionality to your web pages using jQuery plugins. When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) of the page. The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of objects and JavaScript can interact with elements in the DOM to add much greater functionality and interactivity to web pages.

```

Upon successful completion of this module you will be able to:
Explain how to link web pages to external JavaScript files.
Describe what the Document Object Model (DOM) is.
Describe how JavaScript can interact with the DOM.

### JavaScript And The Document Object Model - Lesson Summary
https://mlapinm.github.io/d1072/l132.html 

 
 ```

The key points from this module are:
The following methods can be used to add JavaScript to web pages:
Link web pages to external JavaScript files:
            - File type is given to external JavaScript files: .js file type
            - Values written for JavaScript objects name:value pairs

Add JavaScript code using the onload method in body tag
Add JavaScript code using script tag within header of web page

You can reference different types of external JavaScript file in a web page.
In JavaScript objects are variables too that can contain many values.
In JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
Use an object literal to define and create a JavaScript object.

person is the name of the object in the following object literal
var person = {firstName:"Helen", lastName:"Smith", age:50, eyeColor:''blue”};

The following can be used to access object properties in JavaScript:
objectName.propertyName
objectName["propertyName"]

The acronym DOM stands for Document Object Model
With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.
The HTML DOM model Is constructed as a tree of objects.

By accessing the HTML DOM JavaScript can perform the following:
      • JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
      • JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
      • JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
      • JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
      • JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
      • JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page





```

### Fundamentals Of JavaScript Closures
Замыкания — это функции, ссылающиеся на независимые (свободные) переменные. Другими словами, функция, определённая в замыкании, «запоминает» окружение, в котором она была создана.

### Introduction To JQuery - Lesson Summary  
### Upon successful completion of this module you will be able to:
- Describe the advantages of working with jQuery
- Describe how to link a web site to jQuery plugin library
- Describe how to write the correct syntax for writing jQuery selectors, methods and events
- List the characteristics of unobtrusive JavaScript
- Describe the syntax rules for JavaScript Object Notation(JSON)

### With regards to AJAX the following are advantages of working with jQuery:
      - jQuery provides several simple methods to exchange data with a web browser using AJAX.
      - jQuery provides easy ways to work with data that is returned via an AJAX call.

### With regards to effects the following are advantages of working with jQuery:
      - jQuery has built-in effects and animations.
      - jQuery allows plugins to be used for additional effects.

### jQuery is based on the JavaScript Library
### The following are the versions of jQuery available for downloading
      • Production version
      • Development version

Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed  
Development version -this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)  
jQuery is based on the JavaScript Library
The following are the versions of jQuery available for downloading:  
- Production version
- Development version
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
```


The following are ways to start using jQuery on your web site:

Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
      - Include jQuery from a CDN (e.g. Microsoft)

The following can be used as a short-cut to refer to jQuery:
                       $sign

All jQuery methods are inside a document ready event to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).

The jQuery team has created the following short method for the document ready event.
    $(function(){
       // jQuery methods go here... 
       });

addClass() - Adds one or more classes to the selected elements
removeClass() - Removes one or more classes from the selected elements
toggleClass() - Toggles between adding/removing classes from the selected elements
css() - Sets or returns the style attribute

The jQuery addClass() method adds class attributes to different elements.
You can select many elements when using the jQuery addClassO method.
You can specify multiple classes within the jQuery addClass() method.

$(":header")                      -All header elements <h1>, <h2>..
$(":empty")                       -All elements that are empty
$(":parent")                       -All elements that are a parent of another element
$(":focus")                        -The element that currently has focus
$("p:hidden")                    -All hidden <p> elements
$("input:not(:empty)")    -All input elements that are not empty
$("tr:even")                       -All even <tr> elements
$(":contains(Hello')")      -All elements which contains the text "Hello"

$(document).ready()      Execute a function when the document is fully loaded
click()                                Attaches an event handler function to an HTML element
mouseenter()                   Attaches an event handler function to an HTML element
dblclick()                           Attaches an event handler function to an HTML element
focus()                              Attaches an event handler function to an HTML form field

The following are the benefits of using unobtrusive JavaScript:
      Usability Does not draw the attention of the user.
      Graceful degradation Scripts never generate error messages even when they fail.
      Accessibility If any script fails, the page still delivers its core functions and information.

      Separation All JavaScript code is maintained separately.

The following are unobtrusive JavaScript techniques:
      Separation of behavior from markup
      Namespace (Global abatement)
      Degrading gracefully
	  
	  
The acronym JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.

The following describe the JSON syntax rules
      Data is in name/value pairs
      Data is separated by commas
      Curly braces hold objects
      Square brackets hold arrays

It is possible to create arrays in JSON.

For AJAX applications, JSON has replaced XML as it is faster and easier to use than XML.

In JavaScript a closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables.

In JavaScript the closure has the following scope chains:
     It has access to its own scope
     It has access to the outer function's variables
     It has access to the global variables
