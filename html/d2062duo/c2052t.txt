Sharks are never calm

This train leaves at nine sharp

The collar of his shirt was dirty

She is washing her towel because it is dirty

Why are the seats so dirty

He was trying to stop smoking so he tried drinking tea instead

Why can't you just work harder

There is wide and shallow river near our house

Whales do not swim in such shallow water

i'm kinder than my sister



There is no risk to health

If you were generous she would marry you

Everybody would love such a generous man

He used to be a shy boy

My father believes in the value of education

What is the value of that car

The floor is wet

Is this serious

She tried to run faster but could not

They are poor

That is a difficulty

You were right dear

I live in a flat

It is purest water in the world

Her skin is brown and smooth

The worst thing about summer is the heat

I believe in luck

The street is narrow

My rope is thicker than yours

We will sell the apartment to whoever has enough money

She is a suspect

Am I a suspect now

The owner of that tall house is proud of himself

However your father is, you are not allowed to go here



It is a golden lock

Is this your trap

The only free cheese in the mousetrap

That is the silver door handle

He did not mean to hurt he

It would mean waiting even longer

Tomorrow you will forget talking to me

Yes I remember hearing something

she did not mean to punish them

she needs to punish him somehow

your face needs washing

She admits acting unfairly

He has already admitted being wrong 

I never denied seeing her

He will deny punishing them

Imaging being left there without food and water

I recall him saying very bad things about me

They will never admit that they using our water in their garden

Because of that some couples even delayed getting married

I do not recall drawing it

I imagined watering such a large lawn

She denies being his freind

She risks losing him forever

I do not recommend wash them in hot water

I took your umbrella by mistake

He only made one attempt


Unfortunately you are late

When it was hot cows often lay in it's shade

Now the doctors do not do all the surgeries manually

I had lain down but he was still standing

I feel like seeing the city

This activity is against the law

He would be happy to hear this

We cannot hear the music

Fortunately he is not dead

We need actions not words

When I came in the cat was lying on the floor

It is just an act

I saw you dancing



I had the vaccination a year last

Do not make any sudden moves

He is my age

I had an accident on the job

He reached that age when people believe that they know everything

We need to change

I'm sure he'll deal with you

I won't dealing with you

The entrance is free every day

I eat one egg per day

Can you wait for me at the entrance

The news soon reached his father's ears

Did they measure it's weight

These animals could reach the height of an elephant

But only I can live forever

Leave the city forever

Where is the entrance


who are you to punish them

You always draw big lions with claws

Why was she punished

The dove held some berry in it's beak

You can always see a lot of crows in this place

Where are the gulls

The brown sparrow has something in it's beak

Sometimes I see swans on the lake

The dove brought the good news

There are a lot of stories about ravens and wars

My sister has a green parrot



I will eat neither snails nor snakes

There is a frog in my room

The early birds gets the worm

The cough can be a symptom of many different diseases

I think that cough was one of the symptoms too


there is a new shoe store in the mall

oh we have a lot of furniture

your big boxes are in the bedroom

The desk in the bedroom is not new

Your new furniture is so cool

Look our movers are here

I like my couch so much

Yes we have a lot of plans

where is my big rug

Yes we have movers

Put these plants on the balcony

do You want to buy something special

I need something special for my girlfriend


I like my couch so much


we do not sell our cats, we ive them away fo free

i would like a dog so much

our budget has been increased now we can spend more

my bird is crazy she plays chess

I ate nothing between lunch and dinner

Enjoy your meal Sveta

She didn't expect that I would come

Yes my dog likes pasta

If I could I would decrease the price for you but I can't

This class is really interesting


Five little ducks went out one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said
Quack, quack, quack
But only four little ducks came back
