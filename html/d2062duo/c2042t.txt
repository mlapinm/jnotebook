bees are not dangerous at all

Is that a fly

These are red ants

There are too many mosquitoes in the room

do you see the little green spider up there

I can see a spider on the ceiling

An ant might be small but its legs are strong

Do these bees make honey


The geese walked along the street

When he came back from the usa he gave me an eagle's feather

owls always watch mice at night

harry had a snowy owl

Owls can see in the dark

the geese walked along the street

The beak of this bird is very big

we are eating some chicken wings

my bird has a red beak

it was the only animal in the herd with a white mane

Yes it's a hare

it was animal with small teeth long claws and a short tail

ther are usually ten to fifteen deer in one hard

birds are not mammals white whales are

a tiger would kill him with one claw

The white horse had a long soft mane

What is the difference between hares and rabbits

What do you know about mammals

is a whale a fish

We need to get rid of this raccoon

They wanted to get rid of the beavers first

You are sitting in this room like a mole

We cannot get rid of these mice

The moles killed all my carrots

my squirrel is eating nuts

a goat's hoof is usually smaller

Deer horns can be very big

We won't go back until we see a lion

He scratched his head

His body was all in wounds and bruises

My throat hurts when I swallow

the cough can be a symptom of many different diseases

This wound is small

Pills are not candy

The symptoms might include cough headache and fever
