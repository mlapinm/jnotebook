enjoy your meal

You need to take a detour

was it an ignition

This is a pump

There's always a traffic jam at rush-hour in this street

It ended badly but it could end even worse

He is not yielding to the pedestrian

In your car the brake is on the left

They do not want to fasten their seats belts

Press the clutch pedal before changing gears

Both tires were flat

I took a cab to the hotel

Replacement for wheels are expensive

Chess is cool

My driving licence is in the box

whose truck is this



intersection lanes

what is a vehicle

I ignored all the reminders

You only accuse and judge

The threat was not real

Our mayor is not innocent because he used to take bribes

Please call the embassy

The man has a weapon

There is a big strike near the embassy

We are innocent

A civil society is a threat to bribes

He is rich because of the investments

The threat was not real

The crowd is very big

When did the first state appear

How is economy

The end of poverty in the world is a dream

Now we should stand up and sing the anthem

Half of the population live in poverty

She loves him for his wealth

I don't now our anthem

He wins the elections

The mayor already has a few ideas for the next year

The population wants more

Will she vote


The judge is working in a court

your hobby is cool

cheers mom and dad

a cup of coffee and our check please

The lesson has just begun

It is obvious that they are rich

Yes she mentioned that she was born in China

her dream will come true

They decided not to mention him

Teaching others is not always easy

I ignored all the reminders

You only blame and judge

She keeps her memories in this box

In my opinion they are really generous

Don't judge a book by its cover

The studies are in English



We watched the fireworks last night

Are you going to celebrate your birthday

What are they celebrating

When is the next holiday

That is the wish of your grandmother

He is worried about something else

I'm very disappointed

I doubt it

I'm afraid of spiders

Are you afraid of death

I don't want to disappoint her

He never doubts me

You should apologize to her

He is giving me hope

I want to hate you for this

Do you feel anything

My ex-boyfriend still hates me

My first impressions are always right

You made me hate myself

Aw Sharik is really cute

excuse me I would like a cupcake to go

enjoy your meal

This restaurant is nice

She thanked him yesterday

Excuse me where is the exit

I'm sorry to hear that

And he forgave me

It was a joke


I also have a cat
