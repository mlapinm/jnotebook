My grandfather had a heart surgery last month

Is it a dangerous disease

Keep off the grass

Ten dollars for three ounces of cheese

These spices are not used in Russian cuisine

do not eat my french fries

we still need to buy a turkey cranberries and peanuts

I sell pumpkins

Let's cut the pie into even pieces


Is cucumber a vegetable

Look your dog is eating ham

Honey is not bitter

Her wrist is broken

I can't believe you found that silver ring

Her wrist is broken

Nobody took your gold necklace

Her nails are red

The coach tells me that my leg muscles are strong now

some people get used to living with one kidney

Is the liver on the right or on the left side

The heard is a muscle

This is a kidney

These are fatty oils

My ex-husband used to say that I had no waist

after you kneeze

there are many germs

you are dirty

Hikory dickory dock

the sink is not working

i'm planning

I will make shelves next to the window

the ceiling has to be white and low


no the bone not broken

the sink is not working

i'm planning

I will make shelves next to the window

She's sung it ten times since we got here

Has she spoken to any of them yet

It's getting dark

usually she dressed well but on this day she is dressed poorly

I was working on my new idea when I got his message

I love fresh white snow

It rained yesterday

It is usually chilly in winter

It will be cloudy and windy tomorrow

Did it snow yesterday


That moning was very foggy

That year we had a rainy fall and a snowy winter

There is no chance that he will eat it all

There are many ways to do it

There is no reason to help them

There were three of us in the house

There was only one teacher in that school

There will be five rooms in our new house

There is not chance that she will answer you

There is no chance that he will eat it all

There will be several questions from the parents but not many

my mother feels better today

I feel better

how did he behave

he feels worse than before

how did he behave

it looks like an egg

why do they behave like that

usually she dressed well, but that days she was dressed badly

by nineteen sixty-eight he had become too weak to walk

they had divorced by that time and i could see her again

they had checked hundreds of answers before they checked yours

these important messages are sent by them every day

she had become his wife long before he became my friend

I don't like him, I only like talented musicians

there is no reason to help them

it will be foggy tonight

i don't like when it is cloudy and foggy

she barely moves

He shaved changed and drank coffee

He was shaving when she called

She was checking for new messages when she got mine

are you taking the train or renting a car

some of his answers weren't interesting

who pays their bills

hasn't she eaten yet

they didn't sing as well as they could sing

He spoke more or less loudly, but I couldn't hear him

They were the busiest women in our family

it was a recent book

They gave away all their cats

we read something about this a year ago

she didn't know what to say

is there parking in the mall?

we need a project soon the deadline is Tuesday

This is a road adventure we need snacks

they don't say no

She didn't say she was hungry

She's barely moving

we seldom read their books

on thursdays


she is not giving me my book

please tell me

I have to run

I rarely swim

we rarely read their books

are they good waitresses?

don't worry your video games are in the bedroom

your birthday is the first of March in my calendar

she's grown up since I've seen her

does your head hurt every day or just today

we'll see him again

this room is more often used by women

I can see you

she flies every day

three times two equals six

nineteen minus thirteen equals six

this will be your room, this room is big 2wa

Green dresses

These children read 10 books a week

These mice are careful

it's getting cold

two small children

Adam welcome to Canada

I was careful

this man believes my sister

this young man doesn't give me anything
