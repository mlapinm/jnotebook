My driving licence is in the glove box

No, I won't drive on the highway

There are four lanes on this road

I can not find the intersection

What is a vehicle

Who need a permit

This car has a big six-cylinder engine under the hood

They are pedestrians

It ended badly? but it could and even worse

He is not yielding to the pedestrian

You always have to yield to pedestrians

She took a detour

There is always a traffic jam at rush hour in this street

You need to take a detour

This is the pump

Don't to go there at rush hour

They are used to ignite the fuel in the engine

Then we took a detour through an old highway

This is a rush hour

Where do they keep the fuel

Be careful not to break the speed limit

Was it an ignition

My grandfather used to be a hunter

I've changed my mind

Some thoughts can be very dangerous

She can read my thoughts

A human has five senses

Is balck humor allowed

Keep the number in mind

She compared me to a bear

It does not matter

A strong body make the mind strong

Your attention, please

This goes against common sense

I do not like his sense of humor

It is very simple

And then it will be just a matter of time

It is a matter of life or death

It is better not to compare kids to each other

Is black humor allowed

Her funs are not familiar with her points of view

Her dream will come true

There is no point to talking with him

His sixth sense is his intuition

I had a nightmare with the thousand spiders

I made my decision

She has reminded me twice this week

It is obvious that they rich

It was obvious that she did not love him

I didn't mention your name

Let's subtract it from her salary to reach  her a lesson

In my opinion they are really generous

Do not blame them for their ignorance blame their parents

In my opinion he explained it well

Don't judge a book by it's cover

You only blame and judge

Which only proves that he is not very smart

I believe I will prove it

And who are you to judge them

Her house is further from the bank than yours

Who took the blame

My brother explains the computer for us

She is proving it

The doctor explains that he is alive

The elections are a serious thing

Each society has it's laws

He shows up in court

The mayor eats with judge in our restaurant

Freedom is not free

Now we should stand up and sing the anthem

We live in a society not only just in an economy

Half of the population live in poverty

She loves him for his wealth


I reject you

I won't let you steal him from me

Even high collars couldn't hide the tattoo on his neck

We accept her

Who stole the golden dress

I'm going to rest for an hour after dinner

She was rejected by the one whom she loved

I accept the job

He is always stealing my ideas

He pretends to be a doctor

Throw the ball and I will try to catch it

We are going to throw a party tomorrow

The coach repeated my mistake

She treats me like a king

She shook her head

After those words they shook hands


This horns and hooves belonged to a bull

He treated you well

She pretends to be my friend

I want her to repeat the answer

He treats his parents like children

The house with the green roof belongs to me

You dropped your keys

He pushed her away from him

My brother usually carries books in his backbag

Pull the handle up and then push the door to open it

Could you please close the gate

That man carried an envelope in his pocket

She climbed on the roof to clean it

Squeeze half of the lemon into a glass of water


The dog won't bite you

That was a step in the right direction

My parents raise my brother's children

The pieces are big, chew them well

The foxes sometimes licked or bit each other

The dog kept licking his hands

She squeezed my arm

The cat stepped on a key

I am chewing a piece of meat

My dress is stretched

Both men are chasing you

Let's go to the garden to blow bubbles

He always blinks

I am digging the sand

The dog dug out some bones in the back yard



Remember that deer eat moss

Her house is further from the bank than yours

The ocean surface was very still

Do snails live in the swamp

That is the swamp

My daughter plays with rabbits on the hill

The surface of the lake is like a mirror

Implementing eigrp

I am getting off at the next station
