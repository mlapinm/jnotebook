and things we have prisons that were presented with\nwhen we first open up Inkscape\nif you haven't yet already installed the Inkscape on your computer\nyou can download it free on windows linux and mac so check out my other videos for that\nit's a completely free and open software\nit's not a free trial version\nand it's very very powerful\nit's very similar to Adobe Illustrator\nand has all the same functionality and tools that you would find with that program\nso the first thing I want to do when we open this app\nI just want to show how to kind of pan around and change the way we're viewing this page\nso to do that if we use our scroll wheel on our mouse\nwe can see we can scroll up and down and if we hold down the control wheel we can move this around\nthis is gonna be really important because sometimes you'll be\nyou'll just be seeing whitespace here\nand you won't be sure where your object in your page is\nand so we can hold the pan key and just by that we hope we can pan by holding down the control wheel\nand go around and do that\nwe can also hold down the control key on our keyboard\nand scroll wheel in and out to zoom in more detail on this page\nor zoom out\nso we can find it\nokay and then we can use these bars here to kind of pan around as well\nand we can also while the control key is held\nwe can use the arrow keys on our keyboard is another way we can pan around\nand that just kind of moves that document around\nso we have our selection tool selected right now these are our tools on the left hand side\nand by default we have a little light blue box or on our selection tool\nwhich means anything we click on\nwe can select it and change the properties for it\nso right now we're not really selecting on anything because it's just our page\nbut if we want to draw an object we can come down here to the square\nand we can draw a square\nso I got a little green square because that's the color by default the last color I was using in Inkscape\nso you might have a different color there\nbut the left-click and drag and then unclick and you'll create a nice square like this\nand then we'll go back to our selector tool\nand when we click on the selector tool\nit'll have a nice selection around it\nand we can see that because that's a dotted black line\nand it also has some different arrows ways that we can change and adjust this shape\nso if we click on one of them we can resize the shape of this square rectangle\nwe can also change just one axis so we can make it kind of shorter or taller\nand also with every tool when you

some of the different tools and things we have prisons that were presented with\nwhen we first open up Inkscape\nif you haven't yet already installed the Inkscape on your computer\nyou can download it free on windows linux and mac so check out my other videos for that\nit's a completely free and open software\nit's not a free trial version\nand it's very very powerful\nit's very similar to Adobe Illustrator\nand has all the same functionality and tools that you would find with that program\nso the first thing I want to do when we open this app\nI just want to show how to kind of pan around and change the way we're viewing this page\nso to do that if we use our scroll wheel on our mouse\nwe can see we can scroll up and down and if we hold down the control wheel we can move this around\nthis is gonna be really important because sometimes you'll be\nyou'll just be seeing whitespace here\nand you won't be sure where your object in your page is\nand so we can hold the pan key and just by that we hope we can pan by holding down the control wheel\nand go around and do that\nwe can also hold down the control key on our keyboard\nand scroll wheel in and out to zoom in more detail on this page\nor zoom out\nso we can find it\nokay and then we can use these bars here to kind of pan around as well\nand we can also while the control key is held\nwe can use the arrow keys on our keyboard is another way we can pan around\nand that just kind of moves that document around\nso we have our selection tool selected right now these are our tools on the left hand side\nand by default we have a little light blue box or on our selection tool\nwhich means anything we click on\nwe can select it and change the properties for it\nso right now we're not really selecting on anything because it's just our page\nbut if we want to draw an object we can come down here to the square\nand we can draw a square\nso I got a little green square because that's the color by default the last color I was using in Inkscape\nso you might have a different color there\nbut the left-click and drag and then unclick and you'll create a nice square like this\nand then we'll go back to our selector tool\nand when we click on the selector tool\nit'll have a nice selection around it\nand we can see that because that's a dotted black line\nand it also has some different arrows ways that we can change and adjust this shape\nso if we click on one of them we can resize the shape of this square rectangle\nwe can also change just one axis so we can make it kind of shorter or taller\nand also with every tool when you click on a different tool\nor when you have an object selected like this\nthey'll be options along the top that change\nso here we have a W and an H option with a little with some numbers in a text box  we can change\nand that's gonna change the width and height if you look at if you notice up here while I change this those numbers are changing\nand so if I want to change just the height\nI can come up here and manually type in a number like 50 and hit enter\nand I'll change the height to 50 millimeters which is the unit that it's has selected by default\nI can change this to inches if I want\nand now instead now it's in inches\nso now if I want to change the width to maybe two inches I'm typing two and hit enter on the W side\nand the height that I want it to be two inches\nI hit two on the height and hit enter\nand now we have a two inch by two inch square box\nso if we were to print this out\nit would be two inches by two inches on our piece of paper\nwe can left-click and drag this box around to any point we want\nwe can even drag it outside of the page border if we want to\nbut then if we try to print this page it'll just print blank because it is\noutside of the page border\nso we'll make sure we're always working within our our page guidelines or guides\nwhat else can we do with this\nokay\nso while it's selected\nif we click out here in white space\nwe just see there's nothing selected\nwe can't change these numbers anymore because because there's no selection\nif we go to the bottom there's different colors\nand we if we click on and nothing happens\nbecause we can't change the color either\nbecause nothing selected but if we left click on it and have the box around\nand come down here to the purple color and left-click again\nwe can change the color of this box to a purple or yellow or green any color we want\nwe can also change the size up here now because it's selected\nif we hit the escape key it
