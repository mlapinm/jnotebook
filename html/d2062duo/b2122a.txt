GOLDILOCKS AND THE THREE BEARS
00:20
In a dense forest there lived in a little cottage the family of father bear mother bear and baby bear
00:28
What a pretty cottage it was with bright yellow curtains a pretty red rug and lovely flowers growing outside
00:36
Now the bear family loved porridge and Mama bear made it every day
00:42
Mama bear is the porridge ready
00:46
Oh yes I am just bringing it to the table
00:49
Ah
00:50
That smells nice but I think the porridge is very hot
00:53
I will certainly burn my tongue if I eat it now
00:57
What shall we do now
00:59
I know
01:00
It is such a beautiful day let us go for a walk and when we return the porridge should have cooled down by then
01:06
Come on baby bear put on your mittens and bonnet we are going for a walk
01:11
Oooooh I love to go for walks
01:15
Maybe I will find some honey to lick
01:20
Wait for me papa and mama I’m just coming
01:24
Yes darling we are waiting
01:27
Make it quick
01:28
And so the bear family went out into the forest for a walk
01:42
Now on the edge of the forest there lived a young girl who had beautiful long golden hair and everyone called her Goldilocks
01:52
She loved to spend her time with the little animals in the forest the birds and butterflies and the tall green trees and colourful flowers all around
02:21
One morning she got ready as usual to go out
02:24
Mother I am going for a walk in the forest
02:28
Oh Goldilocks see if you can find some berries there
02:32
I was thinking of making a nice berry pie for dinner tonight
02:36
But don’t go too far dear I’ve heard there are some bears living in the forest
02:42
Oooh berry pie
02:44
I just love it
02:46
I know a place where there are some sweet blue berries growing
02:50
It is not too far so don’t worry mother I’ll be back soon
02:55
So Goldilocks set off towards the forest
02:59
How she loved to go there
03:01
The flowers the little rabbits and oh the colourful butterflies they all made Goldilocks so happy
03:12
I think I will take some of these pretty pink flowers for mother
03:16
I know she will love them
03:18
They will look so pretty on the table
03:22
(La la la la la I wonder where my friends are
03:27
The little bunnies that go hop hop hop Naughty monkeys that suddenly from trees drop
03:33
Beautiful butterflies flitting from flower to flower
03:37
And then flying away far far far) where are all my little friends I can’t see any of them today
03:59
So looking for the rabbits and the beautiful butterflies Goldilocks kept going farther and farther into the forest
04:19
After walking for some time Goldilocks thought she was lost
04:24
Where am I
04:25
I seem to have come very far and I promised mama that I would not
04:31
(Yawn) I am so tired
04:35
Suddenly Goldilocks saw something a little ahead
04:39
What is this
04:40
A cottage in the middle of the forest Whose can it be
05:00
Goldilocks went near and peeped through the window but could see no one
05:05
I wonder if I could rest here for a few minutes
05:10
Hello hello anyone there
05:13
There doesn’t seem to be anyone around
05:16
Oh the door is open
05:19
Slowly Goldilocks pushed open the door looked around and then went into the cottage
05:28
This is indeed a very lovely cottage
05:31
Ah
05:32
I smell something very nice and I am suddenly feeling very hungry
05:38
There on the table Goldilocks saw three bowls that had porridge in them
05:46
This is a nice big bowl I will have the porridge from this one
05:53
Oooh It is so hot I think I have burned my tongue
05:57
Uf uf uf
05:59
After a few minutes Goldilocks tried the porridge in the second bowl
06:04
This is too cold it is not tasting nice
06:09
Then she went to the last bowl which was the smallest
06:14
I like this porridge
06:16
I hope no one will mind my having it I am so hungry
06:24
That was so yummy
06:26
After finishing off all the porridge in the small bowl Goldilocks started feeling drowsy
06:34
I think I will rest here for sometime and then go home
06:39
Oh this chair is too big it is not at all comfortable
06:45
So saying she went to the next chair which was Mother Bear’s chair but found that chair too big also
06:54
I think the small chair should be fine
06:57
But as Goldilocks sat down on Baby bear’s chair the chair broke and she fell down
07:06
Ouch That hurt
07:09
And the chair is broken
07:10
Oh I hope the owner will not be very angry
07:14
Goldilocks tried her best to put the chair back together again but could not do so
07:19
I have been a bad girl today
07:22
I promised mama that I would not go far and I did
07:28
Now I have eaten someone’s porridge and broken their chair
07:31
Goldilocks was feeling very very sorry for being a naughty child
07:36
She decided that she would wait for a while till the owner came back so that she could say sorry to him
07:43
I do hope the owner of this cottage will be kind and forgive me
07:48
I really did not mean to eat his porridge and break his chair
07:52
Goldilocks went to the window to see if anyone was around but she could see no one
08:01
I will wait for a few minutes more only otherwise it will become dark and I won’t be able find my way back home
08:09
Oh mama is going to be so angry with me
08:13
Goldilocks looked around for some place where she could wait and wandered to the next room where there were three beds
08:25
I am so tired and the beds look so inviting
08:29
I’ll just rest here for a few minutes
08:33
She went to the largest bed and lay down
08:36
This bed is so hard I don’t think I will be comfortable here
08:42
Goldilocks got out of Father Bear’s bed and went to Mother Bear’s bed
08:47
This bed is too soft I will just sink into it
08:51
Let me try the last bed
08:54
Goldilocks then went to Baby Bear’s bed
08:58
Aaah
08:59
This is so comfortable and nice
09:02
I will lie down for just a few minutes and then go back home
09:07
I will have to go and say sorry to mama also for being so late
09:11
Though Goldilocks thought of resting for a few minutes only she was so tired that she soon fell fast asleep
09:19
Soon after the three bears came back from their walk
09:28
I’m hungry now after the long walk and the porridge must have cooled by now
09:34
What’s this
09:35
Someone has been having my porridge
09:38
Someone has been having my porridge too
09:40
Oh
09:41
Someone has finished all my porridge
09:45
What will I eat now
09:46
Now now baby don’t worry I will give you some more
09:51
But who could have come here
09:53
No one ever comes so deep into the forest
09:56
Humph
09:57
Someone has been sitting on my chair
10:00
Mother bear and baby bear hurry to look at their chairs
10:03
I think someone has been sitting on my chair too
10:06
Oh mama papa look
10:09
Someone has broken my chair
10:12
Boo hoo hoo
10:13
Boo hoo hoo
10:15
Who could it be
10:16
Lets look around and see if there is someone in our house
10:19
They all go to the next room
10:21
I see someone has been sleeping on my bed
10:24
And someone has been sleeping on my bed too
10:27
Oh look mama papa there is someone sleeping on my bed
10:32
I’m sure this is the baddie who ate my porridge and broke my chair
10:38
Come on papa punish punish
10:41
The loud sounds of baby bear made Goldilocks wake up with a start and she got the fright of her life
10:48
She jumped out of the bed ran to the open window jumped out and ran away as fast as her little legs could carry her
10:55
Oh the poor thing we really scared her
10:58
She ate my porridge she broke my chair
11:03
She is horrible
11:04
Oh come on baby
11:06
You can always get more porridge and a new chair but that poor little thing got so scared
11:11
I don’t think we will ever see her again
11:14
Goldilocks did not stop running till she reached her house
11:19
She had never imagined that the cottage where she decided to rest belonged to bears
11:24
Mother mother
11:26
What is the matter my dear
11:28
You are so late and I was so worried
11:31
Why are you panting like this
11:33
Oh mama I saw some bears in the forest and I was so scared that I just ran and ran
11:41
I dropped all the berries I had collected and even some pretty flowers I had picked for you
11:47
Oh my child
11:48
Promise me you will never go so far again
11:52
I promise mother I will never do it again
11:55
Now go wash your hands and have your dinner and then go right up to bed
11:59
You’ve had a nasty fright but a good night’s sleep will make you feel better
12:04
I will never ever disobey my mother again
12:08
I am lucky that I managed to escape just in time
12:13
Of course Goldilocks did not know that the bears were very friendly and would not have harmed her but she did learn a very good lesson that day didn’t she
