welcome to this Inkscape video tutorial series 
6.180768
in this video i want to go over the basics of Inkscape
9.93152 
and can I just show you the interface and explore some of the different tools and things we have prisons that were presented with
16.820168
when we first open up Inkscape
18.635093 
if you haven't yet already installed the Inkscape on your computer
21.547493 
you can download it free on windows linux and mac so check out my other videos for that
25.3 
it's a completely free and open software
27.105849 
it's not a free trial version 
and it's very very powerful 
it's very similar to Adobe Illustrator 
33.961092
and has all the same functionality and tools that you would find with that program 
37.423077
so the first thing I want to do when we open this app 
40.760227
I just want to show how to kind of pan around and change the way we're viewing this page 
47.046522
so to do that if we use our scroll wheel on our mouse 
49.801545
we can see we can scroll up and down and if we hold down the control wheel we can move this around 
55.798179
this is gonna be really important because sometimes you'll be
you'll just be seeing whitespace here
58.669271
and you won't be sure where your object in your page is 
64.189413
and so we can hold the pan key and just by that we hope we can pan by holding down the control wheel
70.703136
and go around and do that 
we can also hold down the control key on our keyboard 
75.210467
and scroll wheel in and out to zoom in more detail on this page 
or zoom out 
80.45299
so we can find it 
82.146394
okay and then we can use these bars here to kind of pan around as well 
87.818297
and we can also while the control key is held 
we can use the arrow keys on our keyboard is another way we can pan around
94.93329 
and that just kind of moves that document around 
97.373723
so we have our selection tool selected right now these are our tools on the left hand side 
102.205609
and by default we have a little light blue box or on our selection tool
105.527739
which means anything we click on 
107.933798
we can select it and change the properties for it 
110.237384
so right now we're not really selecting on anything because it's just our page 
113.906428
but if we want to draw an object we can come down here to the square 
and we can draw a square 
120.294893
so I got a little green square because that's the color by default the last color I was using in Inkscape 
124.812967
so you might have a different color there 
126.361163
but the left-click and drag and then unclick and you'll create a nice square like this 
130.850007
and then we'll go back to our selector tool 
133.475099
and when we click on the selector tool
it'll have a nice selection around it
137.948772
and we can see that because that's a dotted black line 
140.127452
and it also has some different arrows ways that we can change and adjust this shape 
145.904719
so if we click on one of them we can resize the shape of this square rectangle 
151.804238
we can also change just one axis so we can make it kind of shorter or taller 
157.315553
and also with every tool when you click on a different tool
or when you have an object selected like this 
163.014328
they'll be options along the top that change 
165.704757
so here we have a W and an H option with a little with some numbers in a text box  we can change 
172.409371
and that's gonna change the width and height if you look at if you notice up here while I change this those numbers are changing
177.549797
and so if I want to change just the height 
180.986943
I can come up here and manually type in a number like 50 and hit enter 
185.120948
and I'll change the height to 50 millimeters which is the unit that it's has selected by default 
191.427978
I can change this to inches if I want 
193.506721
and now instead now it's in inches 
195.499332
so now if I want to change the width to maybe two inches I'm typing two and hit enter on the W side 
202.605952
and the height that I want it to be two inches 
I hit two on the height and hit enter 
206.332569
and now we have a two inch by two inch square box 
209.9876
so if we were to print this out 
212.939207
it would be two inches by two inches on our piece of paper 
216.688838
we can left-click and drag this box around to any point we want
221.186247 
we can even drag it outside of the page border if we want to
225.584649
but then if we try to print this page it'll just print blank because it is
outside of the page border
230.092536 
so we'll make sure we're always working within our our page guidelines or guides 
235.61674
what else can we do with this 
okay 
237.929665
so while it's selected 
if we click out here in white space 
240.396139
we just see there's nothing selected 
242.842207
we can't change these numbers anymore because because there's no selection 
246.041103
if we go to the bottom there's different colors 
248.591762
and we if we click on and nothing happens 
250.149547
because we can't change the color either 
252.047812
because nothing selected but if we left click on it and have the box around 
256.037851
and come down here to the purple color and left-click again
258.343736
we can change the color of this box to a purple or yellow or green any color we want 
263.534023
we can also change the size up here now because it's selected
267.158179
if we hit the escape key it becomes
deselected 
270.215897
if we left-click it become selected again 
272.498247
if we click off into white space it becomes Deselected 
276.8506
if we left click it become selected again
278.713309
while it's selected if we left click
again you'll notice these these arrows sort of change direction 
285.913225
so between left clicking if we keep left clicking slowly
290.03946
we'll see these arrows change 
292.263479
so the first selection we had we could change the size of it 
295.122333
but if we left click again we can change the skew
299.320152 
we can skew this square either along the x or y axis
306.120361
306.120361
