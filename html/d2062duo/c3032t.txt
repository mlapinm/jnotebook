It is raining constantly

I am constantly drinking water

Male doctors are working now

What is the purpose of your life

I made two attempts

I do not recall drawing it

They will never admit using our water in their garden

She admits acting unfairly

Do not delay buying house

She denies being his friend

I imagined watering such a large lawn

Because of that some couples even delayed getting married

Yew I recall reading this book

This song is also great

She will deny punishing them

He risked being punished

The book discusses using phones at school

If she keeps doing that she will be punished

Tomorrow you'll forget you ever talked to me

It would mean waiting even longer 

Tomorrow you'll forget you talking to me

I needed to find some help

He did not mean to hurt her

Which dish do you like

The dish is not in the oven

She gave me a silver chain

There a picture of her is in the new magazine

The star is red

This is a silver door handle

He offers me his soap

It would be better to buy our own lock

The only free cheese is in the mousetrap

cut the rope

They were covered in soap bubbles

The king is dead long live the king

The king's first daughter was gifted by nature

Whoever your father is you are not allowed to go here

Come out whoever you are 

Where are the other passengers

The customers can't wait forever

If you were generous she would have married you

Everybody would love such a generous man

what is the value of that car

when i saw her i got very shy

This is a serious person

it is serious question

It is very simple

This water is pure

My rope is thicker than yours

She has light skin

My wife has always been thin

The stairs are narrow

I had a sharp pain on Wednesday

The worst thing about summer is the heat

can you answer the phones for a while

They are very flattering

Who asked you anyway

you do now

thanks for suggestion

gotta meet a friend for dinner

I'm kinder than my sister

This pills are hard to swallow

Why can't you just work harder


he lives in the east of Paris

My grandmother is from China

I live in the north

how many continents are there on earth

She has gone with the south wing

I'm just a little black rain cloud 

we see the sun in August

how blue the sky is 

The island is always there

I swim in the depth of the sea

she lives in that village

that's it

it is the worst building

If you were generous she would have married you

am I on the wrong road?

what is the length of that bridge

He always stealing my ideas

I'm going to rest for an hour after dinner

I eccept the job

we accept only cash

They reject my idea

there is a volcano in this country

There is a volcano in this country

Do snails live in the swamp

It is a city on a hill

The surface is orange

Are there swamps near your house

I won't let you steal him from me

Families need food to raise their children

He squeezed my shoulder

Take one step at a time

She climbed on the roof to clean it

The dog kept licking his hands

Squeeze half of a lemon into the glass of water

he pulls the door

Pull the door

He pushed her away from him

I want her to repeat the answer

after those words, they shook hands

We are going to throw a party tomorrow

These horns and hooves belong to a bull

He treats his parents like children

He treated you well

he pretends to be a doctor


My intuition tells me nothing

her dream will come true

I had a nightmare with a thousand spiders

This goes against common sense

It is better not to compare kids to each other

I've changed my mind

this goes against common sense

keep the number in mind
