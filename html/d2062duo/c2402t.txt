So let take a look first how to implement eigrp

the goal for any Dynamic routing protocol is for routers to be able exchange information between them and learn about destinations that are not directly connected those routers

I so as would say it's about the discovery every networks
many times people call this routing by rumor 

Is this think about it one router a long ways away says hey I'm connected to this network let me tell you about him that router says hey I heard about my way to get here and then I heard about another way to get here but it's hopefully a reliable rumor that we get

Now we also you have to have something that maintains the routing information as up-to-date in other words of a destination is no longer available 5 routers away 

I expect that router to tell us through a removal message that we can no longer get to that destination so everyone knows to find A New Path if one becomes available to get to that same destination 

Now is that how to know to choose the best path because in today is routed networks you may have very closely than a full match of connections between routers any of that from any one point of my network 

I mind be able two or three or five paths to the same destination 

which of those is the best one

kind of again the idea of driving down a freeway 

I travel a lot and so without GPS I'd be in trouble 

but I certainly in the old days could look at a map and say okay 

I can get from here to the grocery store 

I'm going to take this freeway for 10 miles to turn off the exit I should see it on my right 

and what happens when that freeway 70 is closed to a car crash or construction 

now I'm stuck 

I don't know any other way to get there 

and so that's another thing that we see would be synonym of protocols 

as they maintain all that information 

so they're like the local person that says 

oh I just got hit by the construction 

I'll take this other exit take a service tree down there no problem 

so they need to know how to find the best path not just a single path 

and to be able to find is I just said the new best path if the current path is no longer available 

so let's take a look at dynamic routing protocols 

and how they behave differently 

first we're going to start with the type 

whether it's an igp interrogate with protocol versus an EGP or an exterior kit with protocol 

we're only focusing on igps in our course 

but let me first talk a little bit about the EGP the exterior protocols 

of one the only one that we commonly use is called bgp the border gateway protocol version 4 

the goal is if you think about how the internet is put together with different service providers that have their customers connected to their networks 

they want to advertise the routes to their customers so that all other people in the world will know how to get to their customers as part of the service or paying for 


but if you think about it 

you don't want to let service provider 'A' be able to tell service provider 'B' how to route 

we just want to tell you about the existence of the routes 

and that's what the egps do in this case bgp

it's a list of routes with suggestions about how to route to those those customers 

in the igp the interior gateway protocol 

it's all about your managed group of routers 

meaning it's your company your enterprise you're the service provider 

they're all under a common management and we often refer to that as an autonomous system 


and what we're doing is we're keeping track of all of the routes that exist inside of our network

without sharing those routes to the people on the outside 

and that's where eigrp and ospf come in their interior gateway protocols 

now another difference is what do they advertise 

one of the igps I didn't mention I was hoping I didn't have to it's called RIP the routing information protocol
