Now Elvis is going to sing for you the theme song of his new 20th
Century Fox picture, and later in the evening, I want you to meet Robert Webb who directed it.
Now this song, as he does in the picture "Love Me Tender" is when his three brothers have come home from the Confederate armies.
He's the younger brother who's been left back home, and he sings this song to his mother and his young bride.
This is "Love Me Tender."
gentle music
Love me tender
Love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darlin' I love you
And I always will
Love me tender
Love me long
Tell me you are mine
I'll be yours through all the years
Till the end of time
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darlin' I love you
And I always will
Love me tender
Love me when
We are far apart
I'll be with you even then
Deep within your heart
Well then love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darlin' I love you
And I always will
For my darlin' I love you
And I always will
